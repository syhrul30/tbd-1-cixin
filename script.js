  "The Madness Years",
  "",
  "China, 1967",
  "",
  "",
  "The Red Union had been attacking the headquarters of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade for two days.",
  "Their red flags fluttered restlessly around the brigade building like flames yearning for firewood.",
  "",
  "The Red Union commander was anxious, though not because of the defenders he faced.",
  "The more than two hundred Red Guards of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade were mere greenhorns compared with the veteran Red Guards of the Red Union, which was formed at the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in early 1966.",
  "The Red Union had been tempered by the tumultuous experience of revolutionary tours around the country and seeing Chairman Mao in the great rallies in Tiananmen Square.",
  "",
  "But the commander was afraid of the dozen or so iron stoves inside the building, filled with explosives and connected to each other by electric detonators.",
  "He couldn’t see them, but he could feel their presence like iron sensing the pull of a nearby magnet.",
  "If a defender flipped the switch, revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries alike would all die in one giant ball of fire.",
  "",
  "And the young Red Guards of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade were indeed capable of such madness.",
  "Compared with the weathered men and women of the first generation of Red Guards, the new rebels were a pack of wolves on hot coals, crazier than crazy.",
  "",
  "The slender figure of a beautiful young girl emerged at the top of the building, waving the giant red banner of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade.",
  "Her appearance was greeted immediately by a cacophony of gunshots.",
  "The weapons attacking her were a diverse mix: antiques such as American carbines, Czech-style machine guns, Japanese Type-38 rifles; newer weapons such as standard-issue People’s Liberation Army rifles and submachine guns, stolen from the PLA after the publication of the “August Editorial”(*1); and even a few Chinese dadao swords and spears.",
  "Together, they formed a condensed version of modern history.",
  "",
  "*1- Translator’s Note: This refers to the August 1967 editorial in Red Flag magazine (an important source of propaganda during the Cultural Revolution), which advocated for “pulling out the handful [of counter-revolutionaries] within the army.”",
  "Many read the editorial as tacitly encouraging Red Guards to attack military armories and seize weapons from the PLA, further inflaming the local civil wars waged by Red Guard factions.",
  "",
  "Numerous members of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade had engaged in similar displays before.",
  "They’d stand on top of the building, wave a flag, shout slogans through megaphones, and scatter flyers at the attackers below.",
  "Every time, the courageous man or woman had been able to retreat safely from the hailstorm of bullets and earn glory for their valor.",
  "",
  "The new girl clearly thought she’d be just as lucky.",
  "She waved the battle banner as though brandishing her burning youth, trusting that the enemy would be burnt to ashes in the revolutionary flames, imagining that an ideal world would be born tomorrow from the ardor and zeal coursing through her blood.",
  "… She was intoxicated by her brilliant, crimson dream until a bullet pierced her chest.",
  "",
  "Her fifteen-year-old body was so soft that the bullet hardly slowed down as it passed through it and whistled in the air behind her.",
  "The young Red Guard tumbled down along with her flag, her light form descending even more slowly than the piece of red fabric, like a little bird unwilling to leave the sky.",
  "",
  "The Red Union warriors shouted in joy.",
  "A few rushed to the foot of the building, tore away the battle banner of the April Twenty-eighth Brigade, and seized the slender, lifeless body.",
  "They raised their trophy overhead and flaunted it for a while before tossing it toward the top of the metal gate of the compound.",
  "",
  "Most of the gate’s metal bars, capped with sharp tips, had been pulled down at the beginning of the factional civil wars to be used as spears, but two still remained.",
  "As their sharp tips caught the girl, life seemed to return momentarily to her body.",
  "",
  "The Red Guards backed up some distance and began to use the impaled body for target practice.",
  "For her, the dense storm of bullets was now no different from a gentle rain, as she could no longer feel anything.",
  "From time to time, her vinelike arms jerked across her body softly, as though she were flicking off drops of rain.",
  "",
  "And then half of her young head was blown away, and only a single, beautiful eye remained to stare at the blue sky of 1967.",
  "There was no pain in that gaze, only solidified devotion and yearning.",
  "",
  "And yet, compared to some others, she was fortunate.",
  "At least she died in the throes of passionately sacrificing herself for an ideal.",
  "",
  "*   *   *",
  "",
  "Battles like this one raged across Beijing like a multitude of CPUs working in parallel, their combined output, the Cultural Revolution.",
  "A flood of madness drowned the city and seeped into every nook and cranny.",
  "",
  "At the edge of the city, on the exercise grounds of Tsinghua University, a mass “struggle session” attended by thousands had been going on for nearly two hours.",
  "This was a public rally intended to humiliate and break down the enemies of the revolution through verbal and physical abuse until they confessed to their crimes before the crowd.",
  "",
  "As the revolutionaries had splintered into numerous factions, opposing forces everywhere engaged in complex maneuvers and contests.",
  "Within the university, intense conflicts erupted between the Red Guards, the Cultural Revolution Working Group, the Workers’ Propaganda Team, and the Military Propaganda Team.",
  "And each faction divided into new rebel groups from time to time, each based on different backgrounds and agendas, leading to even more ruthless fighting.",
  "",
  "But for this mass struggle session, the victims were the reactionary bourgeois academic authorities.",
  "These were the enemies of every faction, and they had no choice but to endure cruel attacks from every side.",
  "",
  "Compared to other “Monsters and Demons,”(*2) reactionary academic authorities were special: During the earliest struggle sessions, they had been both arrogant and stubborn.",
  "That was also the stage in which they had died in the largest numbers.",
  "Over a period of forty days, in Beijing alone, more than seventeen hundred victims of struggle sessions were beaten to death.",
  "Many others picked an easier path to avoid the madness: Lao She, Wu Han, Jian Bozan, Fu Lei, Zhao Jiuzhang, Yi Qun, Wen Jie, Hai Mo, and other once-respected intellectuals had all chosen to end their lives (3*).",
  "",
  "*2- Translator’s Note: Originally a term from Buddhism, “Monsters and Demons” was used during the Cultural Revolution to refer to all the enemies of the revolution.",
  "",
  "*3- Translator’s Note: These were some of the most famous intellectuals who committed suicide during the Cultural Revolution.",
  "Lao She: writer; Wu Han: historian; Jian Bozan: historian; Fu Lei: translator and critic; Zhao Jiuzhang: meteorologist and geophysicist; Yi Qun: writer; Wen Jie: poet; Hai Mo: screenwriter and novelist.",
  "",
  "Those who survived that initial period gradually became numb as the ruthless struggle sessions continued.",
  "The protective mental shell helped them avoid total breakdown.",
  "They often seemed to be half asleep during the sessions and would only startle awake when someone screamed in their faces to make them mechanically recite their confessions, already repeated countless times.",
  "",
  "Then, some of them entered a third stage.",
  "The constant, unceasing struggle sessions injected vivid political images into their consciousness like mercury, until their minds, erected upon knowledge and rationality, collapsed under the assault.",
  "They began to really believe that they were guilty, to see how they had harmed the great cause of the revolution.",
  "They cried, and their repentance was far deeper and more sincere than that of those Monsters and Demons who were not intellectuals.",
  "",
  "For the Red Guards, heaping abuse upon victims in those two latter mental stages was utterly boring.",
  "Only those Monsters and Demons who were still in the initial stage could give their overstimulated brains the thrill they craved, like the red cape of the matador.",
  "But such desirable victims had grown scarce.",
  "In Tsinghua there was probably only one left.",
  "Because he was so rare, he was reserved for the very end of the struggle session.",
  "",
  "Ye Zhetai had survived the Cultural Revolution so far, but he remained in the first mental stage.",
  "He refused to repent, to kill himself, or to become numb.",
  "When this physics professor walked onto the stage in front of the crowd, his expression clearly said: Let the cross I bear be even heavier.",
  "",
  "The Red Guards did indeed have him carry a burden, but it wasn’t a cross.",
  "Other victims wore tall hats made from bamboo frames, but his was welded from thick steel bars.",
  "And the plaque he wore around his neck wasn’t wooden, like the others, but an iron door taken from a laboratory oven.",
  "His name was written on the door in striking black characters, and two red diagonals were drawn across them in a large X.",
  "",
  "Twice the number of Red Guards used for other victims escorted Ye onto the stage: two men and four women.",
  "The two young men strode with confidence and purpose, the very image of mature Bolshevik youths.",
  "They were both fourth-year students(*4) majoring in theoretical physics, and Ye was their professor.",
  "The women, really girls, were much younger, second-year students from the junior high school attached to the university(*5).",
  "Dressed in military uniforms and equipped with bandoliers, they exuded youthful vigor and surrounded Ye Zhetai like four green flames.",
  "",
  "*4- Translator’s Note: Chinese colleges (and Tsinghua in particular) have a complicated history of shifting between four-year, five-year, and three-year systems up to the time of the Cultural Revolution.",
  "I’ve therefore avoided using American terms such as “freshman,” “sophomore,” “junior,” and “senior” to translate the classes of these students.",
  "",
  "*5- Translator’s Note: In the Chinese education system, six years in primary school are typically followed by three years in junior high school and three years in high school.",
  "During the Cultural Revolution, this twelve-year system was shortened to a nine- or ten-year system, depending on the province or municipality.",
  "In this case, the girl Red Guards are fourteen.",
  "",
  "His appearance excited the crowd.",
  "The shouting of slogans, which had slackened a bit, now picked up with renewed force and drowned out everything else like a resurgent tide.",
  "",
  "After waiting patiently for the noise to subside, one of the male Red Guards turned to the victim.",
  "“Ye Zhetai, you are an expert in mechanics.",
  "You should see how strong the great unified force you’re resisting is.",
  "To remain so stubborn will lead only to your death!",
  "Today, we will continue the agenda from the last time.",
  "There’s no need to waste words.",
  "Answer the following question without your typical deceit: Between the years of 1962 and 1965, did you not decide on your own to add relativity to the intro physics course?”",
  "",
  "“Relativity is part of the fundamental theories of physics,” Ye answered.",
  "“How can a basic survey course not teach it?”",
  "",
  "“You lie!”",
  "a female Red Guard by his side shouted.",
  "“Einstein is a reactionary academic authority.",
  "He would serve any master who dangled money in front of him.",
  "He even went to the American Imperialists and helped them build the atom bomb!",
  "To develop a revolutionary science, we must overthrow the black banner of capitalism represented by the theory of relativity!”",
  "",
  "Ye remained silent.",
  "Enduring the pain brought by the heavy iron hat and the iron plaque hanging from his neck, he had no energy to answer questions that were not worth answering.",
  "Behind him, one of his students also frowned.",
  "The girl who had spoken was the most intelligent of the four female Red Guards, and she was clearly prepared, as she had been seen memorizing the struggle session script before coming onstage.",
  "",
  "But against someone like Ye Zhetai, a few slogans like that were insufficient.",
  "The Red Guards decided to bring out the new weapon they had prepared against their teacher.",
  "One of them waved to someone offstage.",
  "Ye’s wife, physics professor Shao Lin, stood up from the crowd’s front row.",
  "She walked onto the stage dressed in an ill-fitting green outfit, clearly intended to imitate the military uniform of the Red Guards.",
  "Those who knew her remembered that she had often taught class in an elegant qipao, and her current appearance felt forced and awkward.",
  "",
  "“Ye Zhetai!”",
  "She was clearly unused to such theater, and though she tried to make her voice louder, the effort magnified the tremors in it.",
  "“You didn’t think I would stand up and expose you, criticize you?",
  "Yes, in the past, I was fooled by you.",
  "You covered my eyes with your reactionary view of the world and science!",
  "But now I am awake and alert.",
  "With the help of the revolutionary youths, I want to stand on the side of the revolution, the side of the people!”",
  "",
  "She turned to face the crowd.",
  "“Comrades, revolutionary youths, revolutionary faculty and staff, we must clearly understand the reactionary nature of Einstein’s theory of relativity.",
  "This is most apparent in general relativity: Its static model of the universe negates the dynamic nature of matter.",
  "It is anti-dialectical!",
  "It treats the universe as limited, which is absolutely a form of reactionary idealism.",
  "…”",
  "",
  "As he listened to his wife’s lecture, Ye allowed himself a wry smile.",
  "Lin, I fooled you?",
  "Indeed, in my heart you’ve always been a mystery.",
  "One time, I praised your genius to your father—he’s lucky to have died early and escaped this catastrophe—and he shook his head, telling me that he did not think you would ever achieve much academically.",
  "What he said next turned out to be so important to the second half of my life: “Lin Lin is too smart.",
  "To work in fundamental theory, one must be stupid.”",
  "",
  "In later years, I began to understand his words more and more.",
  "Lin, you truly are too smart.",
  "Even a few years ago, you could feel the political winds shifting in academia and prepared yourself.",
  "For example, when you taught, you changed the names of many physical laws and constants: Ohm’s law you called resistance law, Maxwell’s equations you called electromagnetic equations, Planck’s constant you called the quantum constant.",
  "… You explained to your students that all scientific accomplishments resulted from the wisdom of the working masses, and those capitalist academic authorities only stole these fruits and put their names on them.",
  "",
  "But even so, you couldn’t be accepted by the revolutionary mainstream.",
  "Look at you now: You’re not allowed to wear the red armband of the “revolutionary faculty and staff”; you had to come up here empty-handed, without the status to carry a Little Red Book.",
  "… You can’t overcome the fault of being born to a prominent family in pre-revolutionary China and of having such famous scholars as parents.",
  "",
  "But you actually have more to confess about Einstein than I do.",
  "In the winter of 1922, Einstein visited Shanghai.",
  "Because your father spoke fluent German, he was asked to accompany Einstein on his tour.",
  "You told me many times that your father went into physics because of Einstein’s encouragement, and you chose physics because of your father’s influence.",
  "So, in a way, Einstein can be said to have indirectly been your teacher.",
  "And you once felt so proud and lucky to have such a connection.",
  "",
  "Later, I found out that your father had told you a white lie.",
  "He and Einstein had only one very brief conversation.",
  "The morning of November 13, 1922, he accompanied Einstein on a walk along Nanjing Road.",
  "Others who went on the walk included Yu Youren, president of Shanghai University, and Cao Gubing, general manager of the newspaper Ta Kung Pao.",
  "When they passed a maintenance site in the road bed, Einstein stopped next to a worker who was smashing stones and silently observed this boy with torn clothes and dirty face and hands.",
  "He asked your father how much the boy earned each day.",
  "After asking the boy, he told Einstein: five cents.",
  "",
  "This was the only time he spoke with the great scientist who changed the world.",
  "There was no discussion of physics, of relativity, only cold, harsh reality.",
  "According to your father, Einstein stood there for a long time after hearing the answer, watching the boy’s mechanical movements, not even bothering to smoke his pipe as the embers went out.",
  "After your father recounted this memory to me, he sighed and said, “In China, any idea that dared to take flight would only crash back to the ground.",
  "The gravity of reality is too strong.”",
  "",
  "“Lower your head!”",
  "one of the male Red Guards shouted.",
  "This may actually have been a gesture of mercy from his former student.",
  "All victims being struggled against were supposed to lower their heads.",
  "If Ye did lower his head, the tall, heavy iron hat would fall off, and if he kept his head lowered, there would be no reason to put it back on him.",
  "But Ye refused and held his head high, supporting the heavy weight with his thin neck.",
  "",
  "“Lower your head, you stubborn reactionary!”",
  "One of the girl Red Guards took off her belt and swung it at Ye.",
  "The copper belt buckle struck his forehead and left a clear impression that was quickly blurred by oozing blood.",
  "He swayed unsteadily for a few moments, then stood straight and firm again.",
  "",
  "One of the male Red Guards said, “When you taught quantum mechanics, you also mixed in many reactionary ideas.”",
  "Then he nodded at Shao Lin, indicating that she should continue.",
  "",
  "Shao was happy to oblige.",
  "She had to keep on talking, otherwise her fragile mind, already hanging on only by a thin thread, would collapse completely.",
  "“Ye Zhetai, you cannot deny this charge!",
  "You have often lectured students on the reactionary Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.”",
  "",
  "“It is, after all, the explanation recognized to be most in line with experimental results.”",
  "His tone, so calm and collected, surprised and frightened Shao Lin.",
  "",
  "“This explanation posits that external observation leads to the collapse of the quantum wave function.",
  "This is another expression of reactionary idealism, and it’s indeed the most brazen expression.”",
  "",
  "“Should philosophy guide experiments, or should experiments guide philosophy?”",
  "Ye’s sudden counterattack shocked those leading the struggle session.",
  "For a moment they did not know what to do.",
  "",
  "“Of course it should be the correct philosophy of Marxism that guides scientific experiments!”",
  "one of the male Red Guards finally said.",
  "",
  "“Then that’s equivalent to saying that the correct philosophy falls out of the sky.",
  "This is against the idea that the truth emerges from experience.",
  "It’s counter to the principles of how Marxism seeks to understand nature.”",
  "",
  "Shao Lin and the two college student Red Guards had no answer for this.",
  "Unlike the Red Guards who were still in junior high school, they couldn’t completely ignore logic.",
  "",
  "But the four junior high girls had their own revolutionary methods that they believed were invincible.",
  "The girl who had hit Ye before took out her belt and whipped Ye again.",
  "The other three girls also took off their belts to strike at Ye.",
  "With their companion displaying such revolutionary fervor, they had to display even more, or at least the same amount.",
  "The two male Red Guards didn’t interfere.",
  "If they tried to intervene now, they would be suspected of being insufficiently revolutionary.",
  "",
  "“You also taught the big bang theory.",
  "This is the most reactionary of all scientific theories.”",
  "One of the male Red Guards spoke up, trying to change the subject.",
  "",
  "“Maybe in the future this theory will be disproven.",
  "But two great cosmological discoveries of this century—Hubble’s law, and observation of the cosmic microwave background–show that the big bang theory is currently the most plausible explanation for the origin of the universe.”",
  "",
  "“Lies!”",
  "Shao Lin shouted.",
  "Then she began a long lecture about the big bang theory, remembering to splice in insightful critiques of the theory’s extremely reactionary nature.",
  "But the freshness of the theory attracted the most intelligent of the four girls, who couldn’t help but ask, “Time began with the singularity?",
  "So what was there before the singularity?”",
  "",
  "“Nothing,” Ye said, the way he would answer a question from any curious young person.",
  "He turned to look at the girl kindly.",
  "With his injuries and the tall iron hat, the motion was very difficult.",
  "",
  "“No … nothing?",
  "That’s reactionary!",
  "Completely reactionary!”",
  "the frightened girl shouted.",
  "She turned to Shao Lin, who gladly came to her aid.",
  "",
  "“The theory leaves open a place to be filled by God.”",
  "Shao nodded at the girl.",
  "",
  "The young Red Guard, confused by these new thoughts, finally found her footing.",
  "She raised her hand, still holding the belt, and pointed at Ye.",
  "“You: you’re trying to say that God exists?”",
  "",
  "“I don’t know.”",
  "",
  "“What?”",
  "",
  "“I’m saying I don’t know.",
  "If by ‘God’ you mean some kind of superconsciousness outside the universe, I don’t know if it exists or not.",
  "Science has given no evidence either way.”",
  "Actually, in this nightmarish moment, Ye was leaning toward believing that God did not exist.",
  "",
  "This extremely reactionary statement caused a commotion in the crowd.",
  "Led by one of the Red Guards on stage, another tide of slogan-shouting exploded.",
  "",
  "“Down with reactionary academic authority Ye Zhetai!”",
  "",
  "“Down with all reactionary academic authorities!”",
  "",
  "“Down with all reactionary doctrines!”",
  "",
  "Once the slogans died down, the girl shouted, “God does not exist.",
  "All religions are tools concocted by the ruling class to paralyze the spirit of the people!”",
  "",
  "“That is a very one-sided view,” Ye said calmly.",
  "",
  "The young Red Guard, embarrassed and angry, reached the conclusion that, against this dangerous enemy, all talk was useless.",
  "She picked up her belt and rushed at Ye, and her three companions followed.",
  "Ye was tall, and the four fourteen-year-olds had to swing their belts upward to reach his head, still held high.",
  "After a few strikes, the tall iron hat, which had protected him a little, fell off.",
  "The continuing barrage of strikes by the metal buckles finally made him fall down.",
  "",
  "The young Red Guards, encouraged by their success, became even more devoted to this glorious struggle.",
  "They were fighting for faith, for ideals.",
  "They were intoxicated by the bright light cast on them by history, proud of their own bravery.",
  "…",
  "",
  "Ye’s two students had finally had enough.",
  "“The chairman instructed us to ‘rely on eloquence rather than violence’!”",
  "They rushed over and pulled the four semicrazed girls off Ye.",

  "",
  "Dia adalah Ye Wenjie, putri Ye Zhetai.",
  "",
  "Saat keempat gadis itu merenggut nyawa ayahnya, dia mencoba bergegas ke atas panggung.",
  "Tetapi dua petugas kebersihan universitas tua menahannya dan berbisik ke telinganya bahwa dia akan kehilangan nyawanya sendiri jika dia pergi.",
  "Sesi perjuangan massal telah berubah menjadi adegan kegilaan, dan kemunculannya hanya akan memancing lebih banyak kekerasan.",
  "Dia telah menjerit dan menjerit, tetapi suaranya tenggelam oleh gelombang slogan dan sorak-sorai yang histeris.",
  "",
  "Ketika akhirnya sepi kembali, dia tidak lagi mampu mengeluarkan suara apa pun.",
  "Dia menatap tubuh ayahnya yang tak bernyawa, dan pikiran yang tidak bisa dia suarakan larut ke dalam darahnya, di mana pikiran itu akan tinggal bersamanya selama sisa hidupnya.",
  "Setelah kerumunan bubar, dia tetap seperti patung batu, tubuh dan anggota badannya dalam posisi yang sama saat kedua petugas kebersihan tua itu menahannya.",
  "",
  "Setelah waktu yang lama, dia akhirnya menurunkan lengannya, berjalan perlahan ke atas panggung, duduk di sebelah tubuh ayahnya, dan memegang salah satu tangannya yang sudah dingin, matanya menatap kosong ke kejauhan.",
  "Ketika mereka akhirnya datang untuk membawa mayat itu, dia mengambil sesuatu dari sakunya dan meletakkannya di tangan ayahnya: pipa cangklongnya.",
  "",
  "Wenjie diam-diam meninggalkan lapangan olahraga itu, yang kosong kecuali sampah yang ditinggalkan oleh kerumunan, dan menuju rumah.",
  "Ketika dia mencapai kaki gedung apartemen perumahan dosen, dia mendengar derai tawa gila yang keluar dari jendela lantai dua rumahnya.",
  "Itu adalah wanita yang pernah dia panggil ibu.",
  "",
  "Wenjie berbalik, tidak peduli ke mana kakinya akan membawanya.",
  "",
  "Akhirnya, dia mendapati dirinya berada di depan pintu Profesor Ruan Wen.",
  "Selama empat tahun kehidupan kuliah Wenjie, Profesor Ruan telah menjadi pembimbing dan teman terdekatnya.",
  "Selama dua tahun setelah itu, ketika Wenjie menjadi mahasiswa pascasarjana di Departemen Astrofisika, dan melalui kekacauan Revolusi Kebudayaan berikutnya, Profesor Ruan tetap menjadi orang kepercayaannya yang paling dekat, selain ayahnya.",
  "",
  "Ruan pernah belajar di Universitas Cambridge, dan rumahnya pernah membuat Wenjie terpesona: buku-buku, lukisan, dan piringan hitam yang indah dibawa kembali dari Eropa; sebuah piano; satu set pipa cangklong bergaya Eropa yang disusun di atas rak kayu yang halus, beberapa terbuat dari akar briar Mediterania, beberapa dari meerschaum Turki.",
  "Masing-masing tampak diliputi oleh kebijaksanaan pria yang pernah memegang mangkuk pipa itu di tangannya atau menjepit batangnya di antara giginya, tenggelam dalam pikiran, meskipun Ruan tidak pernah menyebutkan nama pria itu.",
  "Pipa yang menjadi milik ayah Wenjie sebenarnya adalah hadiah dari Ruan.",
  "",
  "Rumah yang elegan dan hangat ini pernah menjadi pelabuhan yang aman bagi Wenjie ketika dia perlu melarikan diri dari badai dunia yang lebih besar, tetapi itu sebelum rumah Ruan digeledah dan harta bendanya disita oleh Pengawal Merah.",
  "Seperti ayah Wenjie, Ruan sangat menderita selama Revolusi Kebudayaan.",
  "Selama sesi perjuangannya, Pengawal Merah telah menggantungkan sepasang sepatu hak tinggi di lehernya dan mencoret-coret wajahnya dengan lipstik untuk menunjukkan bagaimana dia menjalani gaya hidup korup seorang kapitalis.",
  "",
  "Wenjie mendorong pintu rumah Ruan hingga terbuka, dan dia melihat bahwa kekacauan yang ditinggalkan oleh Pengawal Merah telah dibersihkan: Lukisan cat minyak yang robek telah direkatkan kembali dan digantung ulang di dinding; piano yang terguling telah ditegakkan dan dilap bersih, meskipun rusak dan tidak bisa lagi dimainkan; beberapa buku yang tertinggal telah diletakkan kembali dengan rapi di rak.",
  "…",
  "",
  "Ruan sedang duduk di kursi di depan mejanya, matanya terpejam.",
  "Wenjie berdiri di samping Ruan dan dengan lembut membelai dahi, wajah, dan tangan profesornya—semuanya dingin.",
  "Wenjie telah melihat botol obat tidur yang kosong di atas meja begitu dia masuk.",
  "",
  "Dia berdiri di sana sebentar, diam.",
  "Kemudian dia berbalik dan berjalan pergi.",
  "Dia tidak bisa lagi merasakan kesedihan.",
  "Dia sekarang seperti penghitung Geiger yang telah terkena terlalu banyak radiasi, tidak lagi mampu memberikan reaksi apa pun, tanpa suara menampilkan angka nol.",
  "",
  "Tetapi saat dia hendak meninggalkan rumah Ruan, Wenjie berbalik untuk melihat terakhir kalinya.",

  "“Tim-ber…”",
  "",
  "Following the loud chant, a large Dahurian larch, thick as the columns of the Parthenon, fell with a thump, and Ye Wenjie felt the earth quake.",
  "",
  "She picked up her ax and saw and began to clear the branches from the trunk.",
  "Every time she did this, she felt as though she were cleaning the corpse of a giant.",
  "Sometimes she even imagined the giant was her father.",
  "The feelings from that terrible night two years ago when she cleaned her father’s body in the mortuary would resurface, and the splits and cracks in the larch bark seemed to turn into the old scars and new wounds covering her father.",
  "",
  "Over one hundred thousand people from the six divisions and forty-one regiments of the Inner Mongolia Production and Construction Corps were scattered among the vast forests and grasslands.",
  "When they first left the cities and arrived at this unfamiliar wilderness, many of the corps’ “educated youths”—young college students who no longer had schools to go to—had cherished a romantic wish: When the tank clusters of the Soviet Revisionist Imperialists rolled over the Sino-Mongolian border, they would arm themselves and make their own bodies the first barrier in the Republic’s defense.",
  "Indeed, this expectation was one of the strategic considerations motivating the creation of the Production and Construction Corps.",
  "",
  "But the war they craved was like a mountain at the other end of the grassland: clearly visible, but as far away as a mirage.",
  "So they had to content themselves with clearing fields, grazing animals, and chopping down trees.",
  "",
  "Soon, the young men and women who had once expended their youthful energy on tours to the holy sites of the Chinese Revolution discovered that, compared to the huge sky and open air of Inner Mongolia, the biggest cities in China’s interior were nothing more than sheep pens.",
  "Stuck in the middle of the cold, endless expanse of forests and grasslands, their burning ardor was meaningless.",
  "Even if they spilled all of their blood, it would cool faster than a pile of cow dung, and not be as useful.",
  "But burning was their fate; they were the generation meant to be consumed by fire.",
  "And so, under their chain saws, vast seas of forests turned into barren ridges and denuded hills.",
  "Under their tractors and combine harvesters, vast tracts of grasslands became grain fields, then deserts.",
  "",
  "Ye Wenjie could only describe the deforestation that she witnessed as madness.",
  "The tall Dahurian larch, the evergreen Scots pine, the slim and straight white birch, the cloud-piercing Korean aspen, the aromatic Siberian fir, along with black birch, oak, mountain elm, Chosenia arbutifolia—whatever they laid eyes on, they cut down.",
  "Her company wielded hundreds of chain saws like a swarm of steel locusts, and after they passed, only stumps were left.",
  "",
  "The fallen Dahurian larch, now bereft of branches, was ready to be taken away by tractor.",
  "Ye gently caressed the freshly exposed cross section of the felled trunk.",
  "She did this often, as though such surfaces were giant wounds, as though she could feel the tree’s pain.",
  "Suddenly, she saw another hand lightly stroking the matching surface of the stump a few feet away.",
  "The tremors in that hand revealed a heart that resonated with hers.",
  "Though the hand was pale, she could tell it belonged to a man.",
  "",
  "She looked up.",
  "It was Bai Mulin.",
  "A slender, delicate man who wore glasses, he was a reporter for the Great Production News, the corps’ newspaper.",
  "He had arrived the day before yesterday to gather news about her company.",
  "Ye remembered reading his articles, which were written in a beautiful style, sensitive and fine, ill suited to the rough-hewn environment.",
  "",
  "“Ma Gang, come here,” Bai called to a young man a little ways off.",
  "Ma was barrel-chested and muscular, like the Dahurian larch that he had just felled.",
  "He came over, and Bai asked him, “Do you know how old this tree was?”",
  "",
  "“You can count the rings.”",
  "Ma pointed to the stump.",
  "",
  "“I did.",
  "More than three hundred and thirty years.",
  "Do you remember how long it took you to saw through it?”",
  "",
  "“No more than ten minutes.",
  "Let me tell you, I’m the fastest chain saw operator in the company.",
  "Whichever squad I’m with, the red flag for model workers follows me.”",
  "Ma Gang’s excitement was typical of most people Bai paid attention to.",
  "To be featured in the Great Production News would be a considerable honor.",
  "",
  "“More than three hundred years!",
  "A dozen generations.",
  "When this tree was but a shrub, it was still the Ming Dynasty.",
  "During all these years, can you imagine how many storms it had weathered, how many events it had witnessed?",
  "But in a few minutes you cut it down.",
  "You really felt nothing?”",
  "",
  "“What do you want me to feel?”",
  "Ma Gang gave a blank look.",
  "“It’s just a tree.",
  "The only things we don’t lack around here are trees.",
  "There are plenty of other trees much older than this one.”",
  "",
  "“It’s all right.",
  "Go back to work.”",
  "Bai shook his head, sat down on the stump, and sighed.",
  "",
  "Ma Gang shook his head as well, disappointed that the reporter wasn’t interested in an interview.",
  "“Intellectuals always make a fuss about nothing,” he muttered.",
  "As he spoke, he glanced at Ye Wenjie, apparently including her in his judgment.",
  "",
  "The trunk was dragged away.",
  "Rocks and stumps in the ground broke the bark in more places, wounding the giant body further.",
  "In the spot where it once stood, the weight of the fallen tree being dragged left a deep channel in the layers of decomposing leaves that had accumulated over the years.",
  "Water quickly filled the ditch.",
  "The rotting leaves made the water appear crimson, like blood.",
  "",
  "“Wenjie, come and take a rest.”",
  "Bai pointed to the empty half of the stump on which he was sitting.",
  "Ye was indeed tired.",
  "She put down her tools, came over, and sat down with Bai, back to back.",
  "",
  "After a long silence, Bai blurted out, “I can tell how you’re feeling.",
  "The two of us are the only ones who feel this way.”",
  "",
  "Ye remained silent.",
  "Bai knew that she likely wouldn’t answer.",
  "She was a woman of few words, and rarely conversed with anyone.",
  "Some new arrivals even mistook her for a mute.",
  "",
  "Bai went on talking.",
  "“I visited this region a year ago.",
  "I remember arriving around noon, and my hosts told me that we’d have fish for lunch.",
  "I looked around the bark-lined hut and saw only a pot of water being boiled.",
  "No fish.",
  "Then, as soon as the water boiled, the cook went out with a rolling pin.",
  "He stood on the shore of the brook that passed before the hut, struck the water with the rolling pin a few times, and was able to drag a few big fish out of the water.",
  "… What a fertile place!",
  "But now, if you go look at that brook, it’s just dead, muddy water in a ditch.",
  "I really don’t know if the Corps is engaged in construction or destruction.”",
  "",
  "“Where did you get thoughts like that?”",
  "Ye asked softly.",
  "",
  "She did not express agreement or disagreement, but Bai was grateful that she had spoken at all.",
  "“I just read a book, and it really moved me.",
  "Can you read English?”",
  "",
  "Ye nodded.",
  "",
  "Bai took a book with a blue cover from his bag.",
  "He looked around to be sure no one was watching, and handed it to her.",
  "“This was published in 1962 and was very influential in the West.”",
  "",
  "Wenjie turned around on the stump to accept the book.",
  "Silent Spring, she read on the cover, by Rachel Carson.",
  "“Where did you get this?”",
  "",
  "“The book attracted the attention of the higher-ups.",
  "They want to distribute it to select cadres(*6) for internal reference.",
  "I’m responsible for translating the part that has to do with forests.”",
  "",
  "*6- Translator’s Note: “Cadre,” when used in the context of Chinese Communism, does not refer to a group, but to an individual official of the Party or the state.",
  "",
  "Wenjie opened the book and was pulled in.",
  "In a brief opening chapter, the author described a quiet town silently dying from the use of pesticides.",
  "Carson’s deep concern suffused the simple, plain sentences.",
  "",
  "“I want to write to the leadership in Beijing and let them know about the irresponsible behavior of the Construction Corps,” Bai said.",
  "",
  "Ye looked up from the book.",
  "It took a while for her to process his words.",
  "She said nothing and turned her eyes back to the page.",
  "",
  "“Keep it for now, if you want to read it.",
  "But best be careful and don’t let anyone see it.",
  "You know what they think of this kind of book…” Bai got up, looked around carefully once again, and left.",
  "",
  "*   *   *",
  "",
  "More than four decades later, in her last moments, Ye Wenjie would recall the influence Silent Spring had on her life.",
  "",
  "The book dealt only with a limited subject: the negative environmental effects of excessive pesticide use.",
  "But the perspective taken by the author shook Ye to the core.",
  "The use of pesticides had seemed to Ye just a normal, proper—or, at least, neutral—act, but Carson’s book allowed Ye to see that, from Nature’s perspective, their use was indistinguishable from the Cultural Revolution, and equally destructive to our world.",
  "If this was so, then how many other acts of humankind that had seemed normal or even righteous were, in reality, evil?",
  "",
  "As she continued to mull over these thoughts, a deduction made her shudder: Is it possible that the relationship between humanity and evil is similar to the relationship between the ocean and an iceberg floating on its surface?",
  "Both the ocean and the iceberg are made of the same material.",
  "That the iceberg seems separate is only because it is in a different form.",
  "In reality, it is but a part of the vast ocean.",
  "…",
  "",
  "It was impossible to expect a moral awakening from humankind itself, just like it was impossible to expect humans to lift off the earth by pulling up on their own hair.",
  "To achieve moral awakening required a force outside the human race.",
  "",
  "This thought determined the entire direction of Ye’s life.",
  "",
  "*   *   *",
  "",
  "Four days after receiving the book, Ye went to the company’s guesthouse, where Bai was living, to return the book.",
  "Ye opened the door and saw that Bai was lying on the bed, exhausted and covered by wood shavings and mud.",
  "When Bai saw Ye, he struggled to get up.",
  "",
  "“Did you work today?”",
  "Ye asked.",
  "",
  "“I’ve been here with the company for so long.",
  "I can’t just walk around all day doing nothing.",
  "Have to participate in labor.",
  "That’s the spirit of the revolution, right?",
  "Oh, I worked near Radar Peak.",
  "The trees there were so dense.",
  "I sank into the rotting leaves all the way up to my knees.",
  "I’m afraid I’ll get sick from the miasma.”",
  "",
  "“Radar Peak?”",
  "Ye was shocked.",
  "",
  "“Yes.",
  "The regiment had an emergency assignment: clear out a warning zone all around the peak by cutting down trees.”",
  "",
  "Radar Peak was a mysterious place.",
  "The steep, once-nameless peak got its moniker from the large parabolic antenna dish at the top.",
  "In reality, everyone with a little common sense knew it wasn’t a radar antenna: Even though its orientation changed every day, the antenna never moved in a continuous manner.",
  "As the wind blew past it, the dish emitted a howl that could be heard from far away.",
  "",
  "People in Ye’s company knew only that Radar Peak was a military base.",
  "According to the locals, when the base was built three years ago, the military mobilized a lot of people to construct a road leading to the top and to string a power line along it.",
  "Tons of supplies were transported up the mountain.",
  "But after the completion of the base, the road was destroyed, leaving behind only a difficult trail that snaked between the trees.",
  "Often helicopters could be seen landing on and lifting off the peak.",
  "",
  "The antenna wasn’t always visible.",
  "When the wind was too strong, it was retracted.",
  "",
  "But when it was extended, many strange things occurred around the area: Animals in the forest became noisy and anxious, flocks of birds erupted from the woods, and people suffered nausea and dizziness.",
  "Also, those who lived near Radar Peak tended to lose their hair.",
  "According to the locals, these phenomena only began after the antenna was built.",
  "",
  "There were many strange stories associated with Radar Peak.",
  "One time, when it was snowing, the antenna was extended, and the snow instantly turned to rain.",
  "Since the temperature near ground was still below freezing, the rain turned to ice on the trees.",
  "Gigantic icicles hung from the trees, and the forest turned into a crystal palace.",
  "From time to time, branches cracked under the weight of the ice, and the icicles crashed to the ground with loud thumps.",
  "Sometimes, when the antenna was extended, a clear day would turn to thunder and lightning, and strange lights would appear in the night sky.",
  "",
  "After the arrival of the Construction Corps company, the commander told everyone right away to take care to avoid approaching the heavily guarded Radar Peak, because the patrols were allowed to shoot without warning.",
  "",
  "Last week, two of the men had gone hunting and chased a deer to the foot of Radar Peak without realizing where they were, and the sentries stationed halfway up the peak shot at them.",
  "Luckily, the forest was so dense that the two escaped without injury, though one of the men peed in his pants.",
  "At the company meeting the next day, both men were reprimanded.",
  "Maybe it was because of this incident that the base had directed the Corps to create a warning zone in the forest around the peak.",
  "The fact that the base could issue labor assignments to the Construction Corps hinted at its political power.",
  "",
  "Bai Mulin accepted the book from Ye and carefully hid it under his pillow.",
  "From the same place, he retrieved a few sheets of paper filled with dense writing and handed them to her.",
  "“This is a draft of my letter.",
  "Would you read it?”",
  "",
  "“Letter?”",
  "",
  "“Like I was telling you, I want to write to the central leadership in Beijing.”",
  "",
  "The handwriting was very sloppy, and Ye had to read it slowly.",
  "But the content was informative and tightly argued.",
  "The letter began by describing how the Taihang Mountains had turned from a historically fertile place to the barren wasteland it was today as a result of deforestation.",
  "It then described the recent, rapid rise in the Yellow River’s silt content.",
  "Finally, it concluded that the Inner Mongolia Production and Construction Corps’ actions would lead to severe ecological consequences.",
  "Ye noticed that Bai’s style was similar to that of Silent Spring, precise and plain, but also poetic.",
  "Though her background was in technical subjects, she enjoyed the literary prose.",
  "",
  "“It’s beautiful,” she said sincerely.",
  "",
  "Bai nodded.",
  "“Then I’ll send it.”",
  "He took out a few fresh sheets of paper to make a clean copy of the draft.",
  "But his hands shook so much that he couldn’t form any characters.",
  "This was a common reaction after using a chain saw for the first time.",
  "Their trembling hands couldn’t even hold a rice bowl steady, let alone write legibly.",
  "",
  "“Why don’t I copy it for you?”",
  "Ye said.",
  "She took the pen from him.",
  "",
  "“You have such pretty handwriting,” Bai said as he looked at her first line of characters on the page.",
  "He poured a glass of water for Ye.",
  "His hands shook so much that he spilled some of the water.",
  "Ye moved the letter out of the way.",
  "",
  "“You studied physics?”",
  "Bai asked.",
  "",
  "“Astrophysics.",
  "Useless now.”",
  "Ye did not even lift her head.",
  "",
  "“You study the stars.",
  "How can that be useless?",
  "Colleges have reopened recently, but they’re not taking graduate students.",
  "For highly educated and skilled individuals like you to be sent to a place like this…”",
  "",
  "Ye said nothing and kept on writing.",
  "She did not want to tell Bai that for someone like her to be able to join the Construction Corps was very fortunate.",
  "She didn’t want to comment on the way things were—there was nothing worthwhile to say.",
  "",
  "The hut became quiet, filled only with the sound of pen nib scratching against paper.",
  "Ye could smell the fragrance of the sawdust on Bai’s body.",
  "For the first time since the death of her father, she experienced warmth in her heart and allowed herself to relax, momentarily letting down her guard against the world.",
  "",
  "More than an hour later, she was done copying the letter.",
  "She wrote out the address on the envelope as Bai dictated it and got up to say good-bye.",
  "",
  "At the door, she turned around.",
  "“Let me have your jacket.",
  "I’ll wash it for you.”",
  "She was surprised by her own boldness.",
  "",
  "“No!",
  "How can I do that?”",
  "Bai shook his head.",
  "“The woman warriors of the Construction Corps work just as hard as the men every day.",
  "You should get back to have some rest.",
  "Tomorrow you have to get up at six to work in the mountains.",
  "Oh, Wenjie, I’ll be heading back to division headquarters the day after tomorrow.",
  "I will explain your situation to my superiors.",
  "Maybe it will help.”",
  "",
  "“Thank you.",
  "But I like it here.",
  "It’s quiet.”",
  "Ye looked at the dim outline of the dark woods in the moonlight.",
  "",
  "“Are you trying to run away from something?”",
  "",
  "“I’m leaving,” Ye said in a soft voice.",
  "And she did.",
  "",
  "Bai watched her slender figure disappear in the moonlight.",
  "Then he lifted his gaze to the dark woods that she had been looking at a moment earlier.",

  "One afternoon three weeks later, Ye Wenjie was summoned back to company headquarters from the logging camp.",
  "As soon as she entered the office, she sensed the mood was wrong.",
  "The company commander and the political instructor were both present, along with a stranger with a stern expression.",
  "On the desk in front of the stranger was a black briefcase, and an envelope and a book lay next to it.",
  "The envelope was open, and the book was the copy of Silent Spring that she had read.",

  "Most of these letters were never answered, but a few of the letter writers did see their political fortunes rise meteorically overnight, while others invited catastrophe.",
  "The political currents of the time were extremely complex.",
  "As a reporter, Bai believed he could read the currents and avoid dangerous sensitivities, but he was overconfident, and his letter touched a minefield that he did not know existed.",

  "Given the excellent lens and refined mechanical operation, it was considered a great professional camera even in this digital age.",
  "",
  "After reexamining the negatives, Wang discovered another strange thing about the numbers: They seemed to adapt to the background.",
  "If the background was black, the numbers were white, and vice versa.",
  "The shift seemed designed to maximize the numbers’ contrast for visibility.",
  "By the time Wang saw the sixteenth negative, his heart was beating faster, and a chill crept up his spine.",
  "",
  "This shot was of a dead tree against an old wall.",
  "The wall was mottled, showing a pattern of alternating black and white patches on the negative.",
  "Given this background, either white or black numbers would have been hard to read.",
  "But in the picture, the numbers arranged themselves vertically to fit along the curve of the tree trunk, allowing the white numbers to show up against the dark coloring of the dead tree like a crawling snake.",
  "",
  "Wang began to analyze the mathematical pattern in the numbers.",
  "At first he thought it was some kind of assigned numbering, but the difference between the numbers wasn’t constant.",
  "He then guessed that the numbers represented time in the form of hours, minutes, and seconds.",
  "He took out his shooting diary, in which he recorded the exact time he took each picture down to the minute, and discovered the difference between two successive numbers on the photographs corresponded to the difference in time between when they were taken.",

  "The countdown began with 1,200 hours.",
  "And now there were about 1,194 hours left, just under 50 days.",

  "No, at the moment I took the last photograph.",
  "Is the countdown still proceeding?",
  "",
  "Wang walked out of the darkroom, loaded a new roll of film in the Leica, and began to snap random shots.",
  "He even walked onto the balcony for a few outdoor shots.",
  "Afterward, he took out the film and went back into the darkroom.",
  "In the developed roll, the numbers again appeared on every negative like ghosts.",
  "The first one was marked 1187:27:39.",
  "The difference matched the passage of time between the last shot of the last roll and the first shot of this roll.",
  "After that, the number decreased by three or four seconds in each image: 1187:27:35, 1187:27:31, 1187:27:27, 1187:27:24 … just like the intervals between the quick shots he had taken.",

  "Wang again loaded a new roll of film.",
  "He snapped off the shots rapidly, even taking a few with the lens cap on.",
  "As he took out the roll of film, his wife and son returned.",

  "First, the numbers, which precisely recorded the passage of time between shots and which showed signs of intelligence, could not possibly have been preprinted on the film.",
  "Something exposed them onto the film.",
  "But what?",
  "Did the camera have a malfunction?",
  "Had some mechanism been installed in the camera without his knowledge?",
  "He took off the lens and disassembled the camera.",
  "He examined the interior with a magnifying glass and checked every dustless component without discovering anything out of place.",
  "Then, considering that the numbers showed up even in the shots taken with the lens cap on, he realized the most likely light source was some kind of penetrating ray.",

  "How could they have been aimed?",
  "",
  "At least given current technology, such power would be supernatural.",

  "The other cause for his fame was that he had created China’s first experimental community.",
  "Unlike the “return to nature” utopian groups in the West, his “Pastoral China” wasn’t located in the wilderness, but in the midst of one of its largest cities.",
  "The community had no property of its own.",

  "Contrary to the predictions of many, Pastoral China not only survived, but thrived.",
  "Currently, it had more than three thousand permanent members, and countless others had joined for short stints to experience the lifestyle.",

  "Based on these two successes, Pan’s opinions on social issues had grown more and more influential.",
  "He believed that technological progress was a disease in human society.",
  "The explosive development of technology was analogous to the growth of cancer cells, and the results would be identical: the exhaustion of all sources of nourishment, the destruction of organs, and the final death of the host body.",
  "He advocated abolishing crude technologies such as fossil fuels and nuclear energy and keeping gentler technologies such as solar power and small-scale hydroelectric power.",
  "He believed in the gradual de-urbanization of modern metropolises by distributing the population more evenly in self-sufficient small towns and villages.",
  "Relying on the gentler technologies, he would build a new agricultural society.",

  "They had made small quantities of a new, ultrastrong nanomaterial that they’d given the code name “Flying Blade.”",
  "But the samples so far were all made with molecular construction techniques—that is, using a nanoscale molecular probe to stack the molecules one by one, like laying out bricks for a wall.",
  "This method was very resource-intensive, and the results might as well have been the world’s most precious jewels.",
  "It was impractical to produce large quantities this way.",
  "",
  "At the moment, the lab was attempting to develop a catalytic reaction as a substitute for molecular construction so that large numbers of molecules would stack themselves into the right arrangement.",
  "The main reaction chamber could rapidly run through a large number of reactions using different molecular combinations.",
  "There were so many combinations that normal manual testing methods would have taken more than a hundred years.",
  "In addition, the apparatus augmented actual reactions with mathematical simulations.",
  "When the reaction reached a certain stage, the computer would build a mathematical model of it based on intermediate products and finish the remainder of the reaction via simulation.",
  "This greatly boosted the experimental efficiency.",
  "",
  "When the lab director saw Wang, he hurried over and began to report a series of malfunctions with the main reaction chamber—a recent ritual whenever Wang arrived at work.",
  "By now the main reaction chamber had been in continuous operation for more than a year, and many sensors had lost sensitivity, resulting in measurement errors that required shutting down the apparatus for maintenance.",
  "But as the lead scientist on the project, Wang insisted that the machine would not be shut down until the third set of molecular combinations was finished.",
  "The technicians had no choice but to jury-rig more and more kludges onto the main reaction chamber to compensate.",
  "And now those kludges required their own kludges, a state of affairs that exhausted the project staff.",

  "Ia mengeluarkan buku harian pemotretannya, di mana ia mencatat waktu tepat ia mengambil setiap gambar hingga ke menitnya, dan menemukan bahwa selisih antara dua angka berturut-turut pada foto sesuai dengan selisih waktu pengambilan gambar.",

  "He had not played any computer games for years, and the hardware for gaming had clearly advanced greatly in the interim.",
  "The virtual reality and multisensory feedback were all effects he had not experienced as a young student.",
  "But Wang also knew that the sense of realism in Three Body wasn’t due to the interface technology.",
  "",
  "He remembered taking a class in information theory as a third-year student in college.",
  "The professor had put up two pictures: One was the famous Song Dynasty painting Along the River During the Qingming Festival, full of fine, rich details; the other was a photograph of the sky on a sunny day, the deep blue expanse broken only by a wisp of cloud that one couldn’t even be sure was there.",
  "The professor asked the class which picture contained more information.",
  "The answer was that the photograph’s information content—its entropy—exceeded the painting’s by one or two orders of magnitude.",
  "",
  "Three Body was the same.",
  "Its enormous information content was hidden deep.",
  "Wang could feel it, but he could not articulate it.",
  "He suddenly understood that the makers of Three Body took the exact opposite of the approach taken by designers of other games.",
  "Normally, game designers tried to display as much information as possible to increase the sense of realism.",

  "Flying stars!",

  "Her suggestion, tagged on at the end as though it was the most natural thing in the world, made Wang anxious.",

  "Wang walked past the three happily playing children and entered the room that Ye had indicated.",
  "He paused in front of the door, seized by a strange feeling.",
  "It was as if he had returned to his dream-filled youth.",
  "From the depths of his memory arose a tingling sadness, fragile and pure like morning dew, tinged with a rosy hue.",
  "",
  "Gently, he pushed the door open.",
  "The faint fragrance that filled the room was unexpected, the smell of the forest.",
  "He seemed to have entered the hut of a ranger: The walls were covered by strips of bark; the three stools were unadorned tree stumps; the desk was made from three bigger tree stumps pushed together.",
  "And then there was the bed, apparently lined with ura sedge from Northeast China, which the locals stuffed into their shoes to stay warm in the cold climate.",
  "Everything was rough-hewn and seemingly careless, without signs of aesthetic design.",
  "Yang Dong’s job had earned her a high income, and she could have bought a home in some luxury development, but she chose to live here with her mother instead.",

  "Wang walked up to the tree-stump desk.",
  "It was plainly furnished, and nothing on it betrayed a hint of femininity or scholarly interest.",
  "Maybe all such objects had been taken away, or maybe they had never been there.",
  "He noticed a black-and-white photograph in a wooden frame, a portrait of mother and daughter.",
  "In the picture, Yang Dong was just a little girl, and Ye Wenjie was crouching down so that they were the same height.",
  "A strong wind tangled the pair’s long hair together.",
  "",
  "The background of the photograph was unusual: The sky seemed to be seen through a large net held up by thick steel supporting structures.",
  "Wang deduced that it was some kind of parabolic antenna, so large that its edges were beyond the frame of the photograph.",

  "In the picture, little Yang Dong’s eyes gave off a fright that made Wang’s heart ache.",
  "She seemed terrified by the world outside the picture.",
  "",
  "Next, Wang noticed a thick notebook at the corner of the desk.",
  "He was baffled by the material the notebook was made of until he saw a line of childish writing scrawled across the cover: Yang Dong’s Birch-bark Notebook.",
  "“Birch” was written in pinyin letters instead of using the character for it.",
  "The years had turned the silvery bark into a dull yellow.",
  "He reached out to touch the notebook, hesitated, and retracted his hand.",
  "",
  "“It’s okay,” Ye said from the door.",
  "“Those are pictures Dong Dong drew when she was little.”",
  "",
  "Wang picked up the birch-bark notebook and gently flipped through it.",
  "Ye had dated each picture for her daughter, just like she had been doing for Nan Nan in the living room.",
  "",
  "Wang saw that, based on the dates on the pictures, Yang Dong was three when she drew them.",
  "Normally, children of that age are able to draw humans and objects with clear shapes, but Yang Dong’s pictures remained only messes of random lines.",
  "They seemed to express a kind of passionate anger and desperation born out of a frustrated desire to express something—not the sort of feeling one would expect in a child that young.",
  "",
  "Ye slowly sat down on the edge of the bed, her eyes staring at the notebook, lost in thought.",
  "Her daughter had died here, ended her life while she slept.",
  "Wang sat next to her.",
  "He had never felt such a strong desire to share the burden of another’s pain.",
  "",
  "Ye took the birch-bark notebook from him and held it to her chest.",
  "In a low voice, she said, “I wasn’t good at teaching Dong Dong in an age-appropriate manner.",
  "I exposed her too early to some very abstract, very extreme topics.",
  "When she first expressed an interest in abstract theory, I told her that field wasn’t easy for women.",
  "She said, what about Madame Curie?",
  "I told her, Madame Curie was never really accepted as part of that field.",
  "Her success was seen as a matter of persistence and hard work, but without her, someone else would have completed her work.",
  "As a matter of fact, Wu Chien-Shiung went even further than Madame Curie (*21).",
  "But it really isn’t a woman’s field.",

  "*21- Author’s Note: Chien-Shiung Wu was one of the most outstanding physicists of the modern era, with many accomplishments in experimental physics.",

  "“Dong Dong didn’t argue with me, but I later discovered that she really was different.",
  "For example, let’s say I explained a formula to her.",

  "She listened to all of them and finally picked something by Bach as her favorite, listening to it over and over.",
  "That was the kind of music that shouldn’t have mesmerized a kid.",
  "At first I thought she picked it on a whim, but when I asked her how she felt about the music, she said that she could see in the music a giant building, a large, complex house.",

  "",
  "Sarannya, yang diselipkan di akhir seolah itu hal paling wajar di dunia, membuat Wang gelisah.",
  "Jelas sekali, wanita itu sudah menebak tujuan sebenarnya dari kunjungannya.",

  "Wang bersyukur wanita itu begitu menjaga perasaannya.",
  "",
  "Wang berjalan melewati tiga anak yang sedang bermain riang dan memasuki kamar yang ditunjukkan Ye.",
  "Dia berhenti di depan pintu, disergap perasaan aneh.",

  "",
  "Perlahan, dia mendorong pintu hingga terbuka.",
  "Aroma samar yang memenuhi ruangan itu tak terduga, aroma hutan.",
  "Dia sepertinya telah memasuki pondok penjaga hutan: Dindingnya tertutup bilah-bilah kulit kayu; ketiga bangkunya adalah tunggul pohon tanpa hiasan; mejanya terbuat dari tiga tunggul pohon lebih besar yang didorong menjadi satu.",
  "Lalu ada tempat tidur, yang tampaknya dialasi rumput ura dari Tiongkok Timur Laut, yang biasa diselipkan penduduk setempat ke dalam sepatu agar tetap hangat di iklim dingin.",
  "Segalanya tampak kasar dan seakan dibuat sembarangan, tanpa tanda-tanda desain estetis.",
  "Pekerjaan Yang Dong memberinya penghasilan tinggi, dan dia bisa saja membeli rumah di kawasan mewah, tapi dia memilih tinggal di sini bersama ibunya.",

  "Wang berjalan mendekati meja tunggul pohon itu.",
  "Perabotnya sederhana, dan tak ada satu pun benda di atasnya yang menyiratkan sentuhan kewanitaan atau minat akademis.",
  "Mungkin semua benda semacam itu sudah dibawa pergi, atau mungkin memang tidak pernah ada di sana.",
  "Dia melihat sebuah foto hitam-putih dalam bingkai kayu, potret ibu dan anak.",
  "Dalam foto itu, Yang Dong masih gadis kecil, dan Ye Wenjie berjongkok agar tinggi mereka sama.",
  "Angin kencang membelit rambut panjang pasangan itu menjadi satu.",

  "Dia tampak ketakutan oleh dunia di luar foto itu.",
  "",
  "Berikutnya, Wang melihat buku catatan tebal di sudut meja.",
  "Dia bingung dengan bahan sampul buku catatan itu sampai dia melihat barisan tulisan kekanak-kanakan yang dicoretkan di sampulnya: Buku Catatan Kulit Pohon Birch Yang Dong.",
  "Kata “Birch” ditulis dalam huruf pinyin, bukan menggunakan aksara Mandarin.",
  "Tahun-tahun telah mengubah kulit kayu keperakan itu menjadi kuning kusam.",
  "Dia mengulurkan tangan untuk menyentuh buku catatan itu, ragu-ragu, lalu menarik tangannya kembali.",

  "",
  "Wang melihat bahwa, berdasarkan tanggal pada gambar, Yang Dong berusia tiga tahun saat menggambarnya.",
  "Biasanya, anak seusia itu sudah bisa menggambar manusia dan benda dengan bentuk yang jelas, tapi gambar Yang Dong hanya berupa kekacauan garis acak.",
  "Gambar-gambar itu seakan mengekspresikan semacam kemarahan yang berapi-api dan keputusasaan yang lahir dari hasrat yang frustrasi untuk mengungkapkan sesuatu—bukan jenis perasaan yang diharapkan ada pada anak semuda itu.",
  "",
  "Ye perlahan duduk di tepi tempat tidur, matanya menatap buku catatan itu, tenggelam dalam pikiran.",

  "Ye mengambil buku catatan kulit kayu itu darinya dan mendekapnya ke dada.",
  "Dengan suara pelan, dia berkata, “Aku tidak pandai mengajar Dong Dong dengan cara yang sesuai usianya.",
  "Aku terlalu dini memaparkannya pada topik-topik yang sangat abstrak dan ekstrem.",
  "Saat dia pertama kali menunjukkan minat pada teori abstrak, aku bilang padanya bidang itu tidak mudah bagi perempuan.",
  "Dia bilang, bagaimana dengan Madame Curie?",
  "Aku bilang padanya, Madame Curie tidak pernah benar-benar diterima sebagai bagian dari bidang itu.",
  "Keberhasilannya dipandang sebagai hasil ketekunan dan kerja keras, tapi tanpanya, orang lain akan menyelesaikan pekerjaannya.",

  "Wang Miao drove along Jingmi Road until he was in Miyun County.",
  "From there he headed to Heilongtan, climbed up the mountain along a winding road, and arrived at the radio astronomy observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ National Astronomical Center.",
  "He saw a line of twenty-eight parabolic antenna dishes, each with a diameter of nine meters, like a row of spectacular steel plants.",
  "At the end were two tall radio telescopes with dishes fifty meters in diameter, built in 2006.",
  "As he drove closer, Wang could not help but think of the background in the picture of Ye and her daughter.",
  "",
  "But the work of Sha Ruishan, Ye’s student, had nothing to do with these radio telescopes.",
  "Dr.",
  "Sha’s lab was mainly responsible for receiving the data transmitted from three satellites: the Cosmic Background Explorer, COBE, launched in November of 1989 and about to be retired; the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, WMAP, launched in 2003; and Planck, the space observatory launched by the European Space Agency in 2009.",
  "",
  "Cosmic microwave background radiation very precisely matched the thermal black body spectrum at a temperature of 2.7255 K and was highly isotropic—meaning nearly uniform in every direction—with only tiny temperature fluctuations at the parts per million range.",
  "Sha Ruishan’s job was to create a more detailed map of the cosmic microwave background using observational data.",
  "",
  "The lab wasn’t very big.",
  "Equipment for receiving satellite data was squeezed into the main computer room, and three terminals displayed the information sent by the three satellites.",
  "",
  "Sha was excited to see Wang.",
  "Clearly bored with his long isolation and happy to have a visitor, he asked Wang what kind of data he wanted to see.",
  "",
  "“I want to see the overall fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background.”",
  "",
  "“Can you … be more specific?”",
  "",
  "“What I mean is … I want to see the isotropic fluctuation in the overall cosmic microwave background, between one and five percent,” he said, quoting from Shen’s email.",
  "",
  "Sha grinned.",
  "Starting at the turn of the century, the Miyun Radio Astronomy Observatory had opened itself to visitors.",
  "In order to earn some extra income, Sha often played the role of tour guide or gave lectures.",
  "This was the grin he reserved for tourists, as he had grown used to their astounding scientific illiteracy.",
  "“Mr.",
  "Wang, I take it you’re not a specialist in the field?”",
  "",
  "“I work in nanotech.”",
  "",
  "“Ah, makes sense.",
  "But you must have some basic understanding of the cosmic microwave background?”",
  "",
  "“I don’t know much.",
  "I know that as the universe cooled after the big bang, the leftover ‘embers’ became the cosmic microwave background.",
  "The radiation fills the entire universe and can be observed in the centimeter wavelength range.",
  "I think it was back in the sixties when two Americans accidentally discovered the radiation when they were testing a supersensitive satellite reception antenna—”",
  "",
  "“That’s more than enough,” Sha interrupted, waving his hands.",
  "“Then you must know that unlike the local variations we observe in different parts of the universe, the overall fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background is correlated with the expansion of the universe.",
  "It’s a very slow change measured at the scale of the age of the universe.",
  "Even with the sensitivity of the Planck satellite, continuous observation for a million years might not detect any such shift.",
  "But you want to see a five percent fluctuation tonight?",
  "Do you realize what that would mean?",
  "The universe would flicker like a fluorescent tube that’s about to burn out!”",
  "",
  "And it will be flickering for me, Wang thought.",
  "",
  "“This must be some joke from Professor Ye,” Sha said.",
  "",
  "“Nothing would please me more than to discover that it was a joke,” Wang said.",
  "He was about to tell Sha that Ye didn’t know the details of his request, but he was afraid that Sha would then refuse to help him.",
  "",
  "“Well, since Professor Ye asked me to help you, let’s do the observation.",
  "It’s not a big deal.",
  "If you just need one percent precision, data from the antique COBE is sufficient.”",
  "As he spoke, Sha typed quickly at the terminal.",
  "Soon a flat green line appeared on the screen.",
  "“This curve is the real-time measurement of the overall cosmic microwave background—oh, calling it a straight line would be more accurate.",
  "The temperature is 2.725±0.002K.",
  "The error range is due to the Doppler effect from the motion of the Milky Way, which has already been filtered out.",
  "If the kind of fluctuation you anticipate—in excess of one percent—occurs, this line would turn red and become a waveform.",
  "I would bet that it’s going to stay a flat green line until the end of the world, though.",
  "If you want to see it show the kind of fluctuation observable by the naked eye, you might have to wait until long after the death of the sun.”",
  "",
  "“I’m not interfering in your work, am I?”",
  "",
  "“No.",
  "Since you need such low precision, we can just use some basic data from COBE.",
  "Okay, it’s all set.",
  "From now on, if such great fluctuations occur, the data will be automatically saved to disk.”",
  "",
  "“I think it might happen around one o’clock A.M.”",
  "",
  "“Wow, so precise!",
  "No problem, since I’m working the night shift, anyway.",
  "Have you had dinner yet?",
  "Good, then I’ll take you on a tour.”",
  "",
  "The night was moonless.",
  "They walked along the row of antenna dishes, and Sha pointed to them.",
  "“Breathtaking, aren’t they?",
  "It’s too bad that they are all like the ears of a deaf man.”",
  "",
  "“Why?”",
  "",
  "“Ever since construction was completed, interference has been unceasing in the observational bands.",
  "First, there were the paging stations during the eighties.",
  "Now, it’s the scramble to develop mobile communications networks and cell towers.",
  "These telescopes are capable of many scientific tasks—surveying the sky, detecting variable radio sources, observing the remains of supernovae—but we can’t perform most of them.",
  "We’ve complained to the State Regulatory Radio Commission many times, never with any results.",
  "How can we get more attention than China Mobile, China Unicom, China Netcom?",
  "Without money, the secrets of the universe are worth shit.",
  "At least my project only depends on satellite data and has nothing to do with these ‘tourist attractions.’”",
  "",
  "“In recent years, commercial operation of basic research has been fairly successful, like in high-energy physics.",
  "Maybe it would be better if the observatories were built in places farther away from cities?”",
  "",
  "“It all comes down to money.",
  "Right now, our only choice is to find technical means to shield against interference.",
  "Well, it would be much better if Professor Ye were here.",
  "She accomplished a lot in this field.”",
  "",
  "So the topic of conversation turned to Ye Wenjie.",
  "And from her student, Wang finally learned about her life.",
  "He listened as Sha told of how she witnessed the death of her father during the Cultural Revolution, how she was falsely accused at the Production and Construction Corps, how she then seemed to disappear until her return to Beijing at the beginning of the nineties, when she began teaching astrophysics at Tsinghua, where her father had also taught, until her retirement.",
  "",
  "“It was only recently revealed that she had spent more than twenty years at Red Coast Base.”",
  "",
  "Wang was stunned.",
  "“You mean, those rumors—”",
  "",
  "“Most turned out to be true.",
  "One of the researchers who developed the deciphering system for the Red Coast Project emigrated to Europe and wrote a book last year.",
  "Most of the rumors you hear came out of that book.",
  "Many who participated in Red Coast are still alive.”",
  "",
  "“That is … a fantastical legend.”",
  "",
  "“Especially for it to happen during those years—absolutely incredible.”",
  "",
  "They continued to speak for a while.",
  "Sha asked the purpose behind Wang’s strange request.",
  "Wang avoided giving a straight answer, and Sha didn’t press.",
  "The dignity of a specialist did not allow Sha to express too much interest in a request that clearly went against his professional knowledge.",
  "",
  "Then they went to an all-night bar for tourists and sat for two hours.",
  "As Sha finished one beer after another, his tongue loosened even more.",
  "But Wang became anxious, and his mind kept returning to that green line on the terminal in Sha’s office.",
  "It was only at ten to one in the morning that Sha finally gave in to Wang’s repeated pleas to go back to the lab.",
  "",
  "The spotlights that had lit up the row of radio antennas had been turned off, and the antennas now formed a simple two-dimensional picture against the night sky like a series of abstract symbols.",
  "All of them gazed up at the sky at the same angle, as though waiting expectantly for something.",
  "The scene made Wang shudder despite the warmth of the spring evening.",
  "He was reminded of the giant pendulums in Three Body.",
  "",
  "They arrived back at the lab at one.",
  "As they looked at the terminal, the fluctuation was just getting started.",
  "The flat line turned into a wave, the distance between one peak and the next inconstant.",
  "The line’s color became red, like a snake awakening after hibernation, wriggling as its skin refilled with blood.",
  "",
  "“It must be a malfunction in COBE!”",
  "Sha stared at the waveform, terrified.",
  "",
  "“It’s not a malfunction.”",
  "Wang’s tone was exceedingly calm.",
  "He had learned to control himself when faced with such sights.",
  "",
  "“We’ll know soon enough,” Sha said.",
  "He went to the other two terminals and typed rapidly to bring up the data gathered by the other two satellites, WMAP and Planck.",
  "",
  "Now three waveforms moved in sync across the three terminals, exactly alike.",
  "",
  "Sha took out a notebook computer and rushed to turn it on.",
  "He plugged in a network cable and picked up the phone.",
  "Wang could tell from the one-sided conversation that he was trying to get in touch with the Ürümqi radio astronomy observatory.",
  "He didn’t explain to Wang what he was doing, his eyes locked onto the browser window on the notebook.",
  "Wang could hear his rapid breathing.",
  "",
  "A few minutes later, a red waveform appeared in the browser window, moving in step with the other three.",
  "",
  "The three satellites and the ground-based observatory confirmed one fact: The universe was flickering.",
  "",
  "“Can you print out the waveform?”",
  "Wang asked.",
  "",
  "Sha wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead and nodded.",
  "He moved his mouse and clicked “Print.”",

  "Sha.",
  "Trust me.”",

  "Wang nodded.",
  "Compared to the idea of the universe flickering, he would prefer a supernatural saboteur.",

  "With our current level of technology, we could take the six-meter horn antenna used by Penzias and Wilson almost half a century ago to discover the cosmic microwave background and miniaturize it to the size of a pair of glasses.",
  "Then we added a converter in the glasses to compress the detected radiation by five orders of magnitude so that seven-centimeter waves are turned into visible red light.",
  "This way, visitors can put on the glasses at night and observe the cosmic microwave background on their own.",
  "And now, we can use it to see the universe flicker.”",

  "Radiasi latar belakang gelombang mikro kosmis sangat presisi mencocokkan spektrum benda hitam termal pada suhu 2,7255 K dan sangat isotropik—artinya hampir seragam di segala arah—dengan fluktuasi suhu yang sangat kecil dalam kisaran sepersejuta.",

  "Sejak pergantian abad, Observatorium Astronomi Radio Miyun telah dibuka untuk pengunjung.",
  "Demi mendapat penghasilan tambahan, Sha sering berperan sebagai pemandu wisata atau memberikan kuliah umum.",

  "Radiasi itu memenuhi seluruh alam semesta dan dapat diamati dalam rentang panjang gelombang sentimeter.",
  "Seingat saya, pada tahun enam puluhan ada dua orang Amerika yang secara tidak sengaja menemukan radiasi tersebut saat menguji antena penerima satelit super sensitif—”",

  "“Itu sudah lebih dari cukup,” potong Sha sambil mengibaskan tangan.",
  "“Kalau begitu Anda pasti tahu bahwa tidak seperti variasi lokal yang kita amati di berbagai bagian alam semesta, fluktuasi keseluruhan pada latar belakang gelombang mikro kosmis berkorelasi dengan ekspansi alam semesta.",
  "Ini adalah perubahan yang sangat lambat yang diukur dalam skala usia alam semesta.",
  "Bahkan dengan sensitivitas satelit Planck, pengamatan terus-menerus selama satu juta tahun mungkin tidak akan mendeteksi pergeseran semacam itu.",
  "Tapi Anda ingin melihat fluktuasi lima persen malam ini?",

  "Rentang kesalahan ini disebabkan oleh efek Doppler dari pergerakan Bima Sakti, yang sudah difilter.",
  "Jika jenis fluktuasi yang Anda antisipasi—lebih dari satu persen—terjadi, garis ini akan berubah merah dan menjadi bentuk gelombang.",
  "Tapi aku berani taruhan garis ini akan tetap hijau datar sampai kiamat.",
  "Jika ingin melihatnya menunjukkan fluktuasi yang bisa diamati mata telanjang, Anda mungkin harus menunggu sampai jauh setelah matahari mati.”",

  "“Aku tidak mengganggu pekerjaanmu, kan?”",
  "",
  "“Tidak.",

  "Mana mungkin kami lebih diperhatikan daripada China Mobile, China Unicom, atau China Netcom?",

  "Desolate plain at dawn.",
  "",
  "Wang stood in front of King Zhou’s pyramid.",
  "The snow that had once covered it was gone, and the blocks of stone were pockmarked by erosion.",
  "The ground was now a different color.",
  "In the distance were a few massive buildings that Wang guessed were dehydratories, but they were of a different design than the ones he had seen last time.",
  "",
  "Everything told him that eons had passed.",
  "",
  "By the faint dawn light, Wang looked for the entrance.",
  "When he found it, he saw that the opening had been sealed by blocks of stone.",
  "But next to it, there was now a staircase carved into the pyramid leading all the way to the apex.",
  "He looked up and saw that the top had been flattened into a platform.",
  "The pyramid, once Egyptian in style, now resembled an Aztec one.",
  "",
  "Wang climbed up the stairs and reached the apex.",
  "The platform looked like an ancient astronomical observatory.",
  "In one corner was a telescope several meters high, and next to it were a few smaller telescopes.",
  "In another corner were a few strange instruments that reminded him of ancient Chinese armillary spheres, models of objects in the sky.",
  "",
  "His attention was drawn to the large copper sphere in the center of the platform.",
  "Two meters in diameter, it was set on top of a complex machine.",
  "Propelled by countless gears, the sphere slowly rotated.",
  "Wang noticed that the direction and speed of its rotation constantly shifted.",
  "Below the machine was a large square cavity.",
  "By the faint torchlight within, Wang saw a few slavelike figures pushing a spoked, horizontal wheel, which provided the power to the machine above.",
  "",
  "A man walked toward Wang.",
  "Like King Wen when Wang had first encountered him, the man had his back against the sliver of light on the horizon, and he appeared to Wang as a pair of bright eyes floating in the darkness.",
  "He was slender and tall, dressed in a flowing black robe, his hair carelessly knotted on top of his head with a few strands waving in the wind.",
  "",
  "“Hello,” the man said.",
  "“I’m Mozi (*23).”",
  "",
  "*23- Translator’s Note: Mozi was the founder of the Mohist school of philosophy during the Warring States Period.",
  "Mozi himself emphasized experience and logic, and was known as an accomplished engineer and geometer.",
  "",
  "“Hello, I’m Hairen.”",
  "",
  "“Ah, I know you!”",
  "Mozi grew excited.",
  "“You were a follower of King Wen back in Civilization Number 137.”",
  "",
  "“I did follow him here.",
  "But I never believed his theories.”",
  "",
  "“You’re right.”",
  "Mozi nodded at Wang solemnly.",
  "Then he moved closer.",
  "“During the three hundred and sixty-two thousand years you’ve been away, civilization has been reborn four more times.",
  "These civilizations struggled to develop through the irregular alternation of Chaotic Eras and Stable Eras.",
  "The shortest-lived one got only halfway through the Stone Age, but Civilization Number 139 broke a record and developed all the way to the Steam Age.”",
  "",
  "“You’re saying that people from that civilization found the laws governing the sun’s motion?”",
  "",
  "Mozi laughed and shook his head.",
  "“Not at all.",
  "They were just lucky.”",
  "",
  "“But the effort to do so has never ceased?”",
  "",
  "“Of course not.",
  "Come, let us see the efforts of the last civilization.”",
  "Mozi led Wang to a corner of the observatory platform.",
  "The ground spread out beneath them like an ancient piece of leather.",
  "Mozi aimed one of the smaller telescopes at a target on the ground and gestured for Wang to look.",
  "Wang looked through the eyepiece and saw a strange sight: a skeleton.",
  "In the dawn light it gave off a snow-white glint and appeared to be very refined.",
  "",
  "Astonishingly, the skeleton stood on its own.",
  "Its posture was graceful and elegant.",
  "One hand was held below the chin, as though stroking a long-missing beard.",
  "Its head tilted slightly up, as though questioning sky and earth.",
  "",
  "“That’s Confucius,” Mozi said.",
  "“He believed that everything had to fit li, the Confucian conception of order and propriety, and nothing in the universe could be exempt from it.",
  "He created a system of rites and hoped to predict the motion of the sun with it.”",
  "",
  "“I can imagine the result.”",
  "",
  "“Right you are.",
  "He calculated how the sun would follow the rites, and predicted a five-year Stable Era.",
  "And you know what?",
  "There was indeed a Stable Era … lasting a month.”",
  "",
  "“And then one day the sun just didn’t come out?”",
  "",
  "“No, the sun rose that day as well.",
  "It rose to the middle of the sky, and then went out.”",
  "",
  "“What?",
  "Went out?”",
  "",
  "“Yes.",
  "It gradually dimmed, became smaller, and then went out all of a sudden.",
  "Night fell.",
  "Oh, the cold.",
  "Confucius stood there and froze into a column of ice.",
  "And there he remains.”",
  "",
  "“Was there anything remaining in the sky after the sun went out?”",
  "",
  "“A flying star appeared in that location, like a soul left behind after the sun died.”",
  "",
  "“You’re sure that the sun really disappeared suddenly, and the flying star appeared just as suddenly?”",
  "",
  "“Yes, absolutely.",
  "You can check the historical annals.",
  "It was clearly recorded.”",
  "",
  "“Hmmm…” Wang thought hard about this information.",
  "He had already formed some vague ideas about the workings of the world of Three Body.",
  "But this bit of news from Mozi overturned all his theories.",
  "“How can it be … sudden?”",
  "he muttered in annoyance.",
  "",
  "“We’re now in the Han Dynasty—I’m not sure if it’s the Western Han or the Eastern Han.”",
  "",
  "“You’ve stayed alive until now?”",
  "",
  "“I have a mission: observing the precise movements of the sun.",
  "Those shamans, metaphysicians, and Daoists are all useless.",
  "Like those proverbial bookish men who could not even tell types of grains apart, they do not labor with their hands, and know nothing practical.",
  "They have no ability to do experiments, and they’re immersed in their mysticism all day long.",
  "But I’m different.",
  "I know how to make things.”",
  "He pointed to the numerous instruments on the platform.",
  "",
  "“Do you think these can lead you to your goal?”",
  "Wang nodded specifically at the giant copper sphere.",
  "",
  "“I have theories, too, but they’re not mystical.",
  "They’re derived from a large number of observations.",
  "First, do you know what the universe is?",
  "It’s a machine.”",
  "",
  "“That’s not very insightful.”",
  "",
  "“Let me be more specific: The universe is a hollow sphere floating in the middle of a sea of fire.",
  "There are numerous tiny holes in the surface of the sphere, as well as a large one.",
  "The light from the sea of flames shines through these holes.",
  "The tiny ones are stars, and the large one is the sun.”",
  "",
  "“That’s a very interesting model.”",
  "Wang looked at the giant copper sphere again and guessed at its purpose.",
  "“But there’s a problem with your theory.",
  "When the sun rises or sets, we can see its motion against the background of fixed stars.",
  "But in your hollow sphere, all the holes remain in fixed positions relative to each other.”",
  "",
  "“Correct!",
  "That’s why I’ve modified my model.",
  "The universal sphere is made of two spheres, one inside the other.",
  "The sky we can see is the surface of the inner sphere.",
  "The outer sphere has one large hole while the inner sphere has many small holes.",
  "The light coming through the hole in the outer sphere is reflected and scattered many times in the space between the two spheres, filling it with light.",
  "Then the light comes in through the tiny holes in the inner sphere, and that’s how we see the stars.”",
  "",
  "“What about the sun?”",
  "",
  "“The sun is the result of the large hole in the outer sphere being projected onto the inner one.",
  "The projection is so bright that it penetrates the inner sphere like the shell of an egg, and that is how we see the sun.",
  "Around the spot of light, the scattered light rays are also very bright, and can be seen through the inner shell.",
  "That is why we can see a clear sky during the day.”",
  "",
  "“What is the force that propels the two spheres in their irregular motion?”",
  "",
  "“It’s the force of the sea of fire outside the two spheres.”",
  "",
  "“But the sun’s brightness and size change over time.",
  "In your double-shell model, the sun’s size and brightness ought to be fixed.",
  "Even if the brightness of the flames in the sea of fire is inconstant, the size of the hole would not be.”",
  "",
  "“Your conception of this model is too simplistic.",
  "As conditions in the sea of fire shift and change, the two shells will expand and shrink.",
  "This leads to changes in the size and brightness of the sun.”",
  "",
  "“What about the flying stars?”",
  "",
  "“Flying stars?",
  "Why do you care about them?",
  "They’re not important.",
  "Maybe just some random dust flying about the inside of the universal spheres.”",
  "",
  "“No, I think the flying stars are extremely important.",
  "Otherwise, how does your model explain the sudden extinguishing of the sun during the time of Confucius?”",
  "",
  "“That’s a rare exception.",
  "Maybe it was because a dark spot or cloud in the sea of fire just happened to pass over the big hole in the outer shell.”",
  "",
  "Wang pointed to the large copper sphere.",
  "“This must be your model, then?”",
  "",
  "“Yes.",
  "I built a machine to replicate the universe.",
  "The complex gears that move the sphere simulate the forces from the sea of fire.",
  "The laws governing such motion are based on the distribution of flames in the sea of fire and the currents within it.",
  "I deduced them from hundreds of years of observations.”",
  "",
  "“Can this sphere contract and expand?”",
  "",
  "“Of course.",
  "Right now it’s slowly contracting.”",
  "",
  "Wang used the handrail at the edge of the platform as a fixed visual reference.",
  "He found Mozi’s assertion to be true.",
  "",
  "“And there’s an inner shell inside this sphere?”",
  "",
  "“Of course.",
  "The inner shell moves within the outer shell through another complex set of mechanisms.”",
  "",
  "“Truly a skillfully designed machine!”",
  "Wang’s praise was heartfelt.",
  "“But I don’t see a large hole in the outer shell to cast the sun’s light onto the inner shell.”",
  "",
  "“There is no hole.",
  "On the inner surface of the outer shell I have installed a source of light to simulate the hole.",
  "The light source is made of the luminescent material gathered from hundreds of thousands of fireflies.",
  "I used a cool light because the inner shell is made of translucent plaster, which is not a good heat conductor.",
  "This way, I can avoid the problem of too much heat accumulating inside the sphere that we would have with a regular source of light.",
  "The observer can then stay inside for a long time.”",
  "",
  "“There’s a person inside the sphere?”",
  "",
  "“Yes.",
  "A clerk stands on top of a shelf with a wheeled base that is kept at the center of the sphere.",
  "After we set up the model universe to correspond to the current state of the real universe, the motion of the model thereafter should be an accurate simulation of the future, including the motion of the sun.",
  "After the clerk records the movements of the sun, we will have a precise calendar.",
  "This is the dream of hundreds of civilizations before us.",
  "",
  "“And it looks like you have come at an opportune time.",
  "According to the model universe, a four-year-long Stable Era is about to begin.",
  "Emperor Wu of Han has just issued the order to rehydrate based on my prediction.",
  "Let’s wait for sunrise!”",
  "",
  "Mozi brought up the game’s interface and slightly increased the rate of passage of game time.",
  "A red sun rose above the horizon, and the numerous frozen lakes and ponds scattered over the plain began to melt.",
  "These lakes had been covered by dust and had merged into the dun ground, but now they turned into numerous mirrors, as though the earth had opened many eyes.",
  "From up so high, Wang couldn’t see the details of rehydration, but he could see more and more people gathered on the shores of the lakes like swarms of ants coming out of their nests in spring.",
  "The world had once again been revived.",
  "",
  "“Do you not want to join this wonderful life?”",
  "Mozi asked, pointing to the ground below.",
  "“When women are first revived, they crave love.",
  "There is no reason for you to stay here any longer.",
  "The game is over.",
  "I am the winner.”",
  "",
  "“As a piece of machinery, your model universe is indeed incomparable.",
  "But as for its predictions.",
  "… May I use your telescope to observe something?”",
  "",
  "“Please.”",
  "Mozi gestured at the large telescope.",
  "",
  "Wang walked up to the instrument and paused.",
  "“How can I use it to observe the sun?”",
  "",
  "Mozi retrieved a black, circular piece of glass.",
  "“Use this smoked glass filter.”",
  "He inserted it in front of the eyepiece.",
  "",
  "Wang aimed the telescope at the sun, now halfway up the sky.",
  "He was impressed by Mozi’s imagination.",
  "The sun did indeed look like a hole through which a sea of fire could be seen, a small view into a much larger whole.",
  "",
  "But as he examined the image in the telescope more closely, he realized that the sun was different from the sun he was used to in real life.",
  "The sun here had a small core.",
  "He imagined the sun as an eye.",
  "The core was like the eye’s pupil, and though it was small, it was bright and dense.",
  "The layers surrounding it, by contrast, appeared insubstantial, wispy, gaseous.",
  "The fact that he could see through the outside layers to the core indicated that those layers were transparent or translucent, and the light from those layers was likely just scattered light from the core.",
  "",
  "The details in the image of the sun stunned Wang.",
  "He was once again assured that the game designers had hidden a vast amount of data within the superficially simple images, just waiting to be revealed by players.",
  "",
  "As Wang pondered the meaning of the sun’s structure, he became excited.",
  "Because time in the game was now passing quickly, the sun was already in the west.",
  "Wang stood, adjusted the telescope to aim at the sun again, and tracked it until it dipped below the horizon.",
  "",
  "Night fell, and the bonfires across the plains mirrored the sky full of stars.",
  "Wang took off the smoked glass filter and continued to scan the skies.",
  "He was most interested in the flying stars, and shortly found two.",
  "He only had time to observe one of them briefly before it was dawn again.",
  "So he inserted the filter and continued to observe the sun.",
  "…",
  "",
  "In this manner Wang performed astronomical observations for more than ten days, enjoying the thrill of discovery.",
  "Indeed, the fact that time within the game had been sped up helped with the observations, as the motion of celestial bodies became more apparent.",
  "",
  "On the seventeenth day of the Stable Era, five hours after the predicted time for sunrise, the world was still under cover of dark night.",
  "Multitudes thronged at the foot of the pyramid, their innumerable torches flickering in the chill wind.",
  "",
  "“The sun will probably not rise again.",
  "It is like at the end of Civilization Number 137,” Wang said to Mozi.",
  "",
  "Mozi stroked his beard and smiled confidently.",
  "“Do not fret.",
  "The sun will rise soon, and the Stable Era will continue.",
  "I’ve already learned the secret of the motion of the universal machine.",
  "My predictions cannot be wrong.”",
  "",
  "As though confirming Mozi’s words, the sky over the horizon brightened with dawn’s first light.",
  "The crowd around the pyramid shouted in joy.",
  "",
  "The silvery light brightened far more rapidly than usual, as though the rising sun wanted to make up for lost time.",
  "Soon, the light covered half the sky, even though the sun was still below the horizon.",
  "The world was already as bright as midday.",
  "",
  "Wang looked toward the horizon and saw it giving off a blinding glare.",
  "The glowing horizon arched upward and became a curve that spread from one edge of his visual field to the other.",
  "He soon realized that he wasn’t seeing the horizon, but the edge of the rising sun, an incomparably immense sun.",
  "",
  "After his eyes adjusted to the bright light, the horizon reappeared in its old place.",
  "Wang saw columns of black smoke rising in the distance, especially clear against the glowing background of the solar disk.",
  "A fast horse rushed toward the pyramid from the direction of the rising sun, the dust from its hooves forming a distinct line across the plains.",
  "",
  "The crowd parted before the horse, and Wang heard the rider scream at the top of his lungs: “Dehydrate!",
  "Dehydrate!”",
  "",
  "Following the rider was a herd of cattle, horses, and other animals.",
  "Their bodies were on fire and they moved across the ground like a burning carpet.",
  "",
  "Half of the gigantic sun’s disk was now above the horizon, taking up much of the sky.",
  "The earth seemed to slowly sink down against a brilliant wall.",
  "Wang could clearly make out the fine structures on the surface of the sun: eddies and surging waves filling the sea of flames; sunspots floating along random paths like ghosts; the corona lazily spreading out like golden sleeves.",
  "",
  "On the ground, both those who had already dehydrated and those who hadn’t began to burn like countless logs thrown into the belly of a furnace.",
  "The flames that consumed them were even brighter than glowing charcoal in a furnace, but were quickly extinguished.",
  "",
  "The giant sun continued to rise and soon filled most of the sky.",
  "Wang looked up and felt his perspective shift.",
  "Suddenly he was no longer looking up, but down.",
  "The surface of the giant sun became a fiery earth, and he felt himself falling toward this brilliant hell.",
  "",
  "Lakes and ponds began to evaporate, and puffs of white steam rose up like mushroom clouds.",
  "They rose, spilled open, and dispersed, covering the ashes of the dead.",
  "",
  "“The Stable Era will continue.",
  "The universe is a machine.",
  "I created this machine.",
  "The Stable Era will continue.",
  "The universe…”",
  "",
  "Wang turned his head.",
  "The voice belonged to Mozi, who was already on fire.",
  "His body was encased within a column of tall, orange flame, and his skin crinkled and turned into charcoal.",
  "But his two eyes still shone with a light that was distinct from the fire consuming him.",
  "His two hands, already burning pieces of charcoal, held up the cloud of swirling ashes that had once been his calendar.",
  "",
  "Wang was burning up as well.",
  "He lifted his two hands and saw two torches.",
  "",
  "The sun briskly moved to the west, revealing the sky behind it.",
  "It soon fell below the horizon, and the ground seemed to rise against the brilliant wall this time.",
  "A dazzling sunset swiftly turned to night, as though a pair of giant hands had pulled a black cloth over a world that had turned to ash.",
  "",
  "The earth glowed with a dim red light like a piece of charcoal just retrieved from a furnace.",
  "For a brief moment, Wang saw the stars, but soon steam and smoke hid the sky and covered everything on the red-glowing earth.",
  "The world sank into a dark chaos.",
  "A red line of text appeared:",
  "",
  "Civilization Number 141 fell into ruin in flames.",
  "This civilization had advanced to the Eastern Han Period.",
  "",
  "The seed of civilization remains.",
  "It will germinate and again progress through the unpredictable world of Three Body.",
  "We invite you to log on in the future.",
  "",
  "Wang took off the V-suit.",
  "After his mind had calmed down a bit, he again had the thought that Three Body was deliberately pretending to be merely illusory, while in fact possessing some deep reality.",
  "The real world in front of him, on the other hand, had begun to seem like the superficially complex, but in truth rather simple, Along the River During the Qingming Festival.",
  "",
  "*   *   *",
  "",
  "The next day, Wang went to the Nanotechnology Research Center.",
  "Other than some minor confusion due to his absence the day before, everything was normal.",
  "He found work to be an effective tranquilizer.",
  "As long as he was absorbed by it, he was no longer bothered by his nightmarish worries.",
  "He deliberately kept himself constantly busy the whole day and left the lab only after it was dark.",
  "",
  "As soon as Wang left the Research Center building, the nightmarelike feeling caught up to him.",
  "He felt like the starry sky was a magnifying glass that covered the world, and he was a tiny insect below the lens with nowhere to hide.",
  "",
  "He had to find something to occupy himself.",
  "Then he thought of Yang Dong’s mother Ye Wenjie and drove to her home.",
  "",
  "Ye was alone at home.",
  "When Wang entered, she was sitting on the sofa reading.",
  "Wang noticed that her eyes were both myopic and presbyopic, and she had to switch glasses both when she read and when she looked at something far away.",
  "She was very happy to see Wang, and said that he looked much better than the last time he had come to see her.",
  "",
  "Wang chuckled.",
  "“It’s all because of your ginseng.”",

  "Ye shook her head.",
  "“What I gave you wasn’t very good.",

  "Ye waved her hand, as though trying to wave away a strand of spider silk.",
  "“In the past, it’s all in the past.",
  "… Last night, Ruishan called me.",
  "He was in such a hurry that I had a hard time understanding him.",
  "All I got was that something seemed to have happened to you.",
  "Xiao Wang, let me tell you: By the time you’re my age, you’ll realize that everything you once thought mattered so much turns out to mean very little.”",
  "",
  "“Thank you,” Wang said.",
  "He once again felt the warmth that he had missed.",
  "In his current state, his mental stability depended on two pillars: this old woman, who had weathered so many storms and become as gentle as water, and Shi Qiang, the man who feared nothing because he knew nothing.",

  "Ye continued.",

  "Ye nodded.",

  "“Not rumors.",
  "If you want, I can tell you some of what I experienced.”",

  "“That’s true—it’s still classified.",

  "Mozi mengangguk pada Wang dengan takzim.",
  "Kemudian dia mendekat.",
  "\"Selama tiga ratus enam puluh dua ribu tahun kau pergi, peradaban telah lahir kembali empat kali lagi.",
  "Peradaban-peradaban ini berjuang untuk berkembang melalui pergantian Era Kekacauan dan Era Stabil yang tidak teratur.",
  "Yang paling singkat umurnya hanya sampai separuh Zaman Batu, tetapi Peradaban Nomor 139 memecahkan rekor dan berkembang sampai ke Zaman Uap.\"",

  "Dalam cahaya fajar, kerangka itu memancarkan kilau seputih salju dan tampak sangat halus.",
  "",
  "Secara menakjubkan, kerangka itu berdiri sendiri.",
  "Posturnya anggun dan elegan.",
  "Satu tangan berada di bawah dagu, seolah sedang mengelus janggut yang sudah lama hilang.",
  "Kepalanya sedikit mendongak, seolah mempertanyakan langit dan bumi.",
  "",
  "\"Itu Konfusius,\" kata Mozi.",
  "\"Dia percaya bahwa segala sesuatu harus sesuai dengan li, konsep tata krama dan kepatutan Konfusianisme, dan tidak ada satu pun di alam semesta yang boleh dikecualikan darinya.",
  "Dia menciptakan sistem ritual dan berharap dapat memprediksi gerak matahari dengannya.\"",

  "\"Aku bisa membayangkan hasilnya.\"",
  "",

  "Padam?\"",
  "",
  "\"Ya.",
  "Matahari perlahan meredup, mengecil, lalu padam secara tiba-tiba.",
  "Malam pun turun.",

  "\"Aku punya misi: mengamati pergerakan matahari yang presisi.",
  "Para dukun, ahli metafisika, dan penganut Tao itu semuanya tidak berguna.",
  "Seperti perumpamaan tentang orang-orang kutu buku yang bahkan tak bisa membedakan jenis biji-bijian, mereka tidak bekerja dengan tangan mereka, dan tidak tahu apa pun yang praktis.",

  "Wang mengangguk secara khusus ke arah bola tembaga raksasa itu.",

  "\"Aku juga punya teori, tapi tidak mistis.",
  "Teoriku berasal dari sejumlah besar pengamatan.",
  "Pertama, tahukah kau apa itu alam semesta?",
  "Alam semesta adalah sebuah mesin.\"",
  "",
  "\"Itu bukan wawasan yang sangat mendalam.\"",
  "",
  "\"Izinkan aku lebih spesifik: Alam semesta adalah bola berongga yang mengapung di tengah lautan api.",

  "Cahaya dari lautan api bersinar melalui lubang-lubang ini.",
  "Lubang-lubang kecil adalah bintang, dan lubang besar adalah matahari.\"",

  "\"Benar!",
  "Itulah sebabnya aku memodifikasi modelku.",
  "Bola semesta terbuat dari dua bola, satu di dalam yang lain.",
  "Langit yang bisa kita lihat adalah permukaan bola bagian dalam.",
  "Bola luar memiliki satu lubang besar sementara bola dalam memiliki banyak lubang kecil.",
  "Cahaya yang masuk melalui lubang di bola luar dipantulkan dan disebarkan berkali-kali di ruang antara kedua bola, mengisinya dengan cahaya.",
  "Kemudian cahaya masuk melalui lubang-lubang kecil di bola dalam, dan begitulah cara kita melihat bintang-bintang.\"",
  "",
  "\"Bagaimana dengan matahari?\"",
  "",
  "\"Matahari adalah hasil dari lubang besar di bola luar yang diproyeksikan ke bola dalam.",
  "Proyeksi itu begitu terang hingga menembus bola dalam seperti cangkang telur, dan begitulah cara kita melihat matahari.",
  "Di sekitar titik cahaya itu, sinar cahaya yang tersebar juga sangat terang, dan bisa terlihat melalui cangkang dalam.",
  "Itulah sebabnya kita bisa melihat langit yang cerah di siang hari.\"",
  "",
  "\"Gaya apa yang mendorong kedua bola itu dalam gerakan tak beraturan mereka?\"",
  "",
  "\"Itu adalah gaya dari lautan api di luar kedua bola tersebut.\"",
  "",
  "\"Tapi kecerahan dan ukuran matahari berubah seiring waktu.",
  "Dalam model cangkang gandamu, ukuran dan kecerahan matahari seharusnya tetap.",
  "Bahkan jika kecerahan api di lautan api tidak konstan, ukuran lubangnya tidak akan berubah.\"",
  "",
  "\"Konsepsimu tentang model ini terlalu sederhana.",
  "Saat kondisi di lautan api bergeser dan berubah, kedua cangkang akan memuai dan menyusut.",
  "Ini menyebabkan perubahan ukuran dan kecerahan matahari.\"",
  "",
  "\"Bagaimana dengan bintang terbang?\"",
  "",
  "\"Bintang terbang?",
  "Kenapa kau peduli dengan mereka?",
  "Mereka tidak penting.",
  "Mungkin hanya debu acak yang beterbangan di dalam bola semesta.\"",
  "",
  "\"Tidak, menurutku bintang terbang itu sangat penting.",
  "Kalau tidak, bagaimana modelmu menjelaskan padamnya matahari secara tiba-tiba pada masa Konfusius?\"",
  "",
  "\"Itu pengecualian langka.",
  "Mungkin karena bintik gelap atau awan di lautan api kebetulan melewati lubang besar di cangkang luar.\"",
  "",
  "Wang menunjuk ke bola tembaga besar itu.",
  "\"Kalau begitu, ini pasti modelmu?\"",
  "",
  "\"Ya.",
  "Aku membangun mesin untuk mereplikasi alam semesta.",
  "Roda gigi rumit yang menggerakkan bola itu menyimulasikan gaya dari lautan api.",
  "Hukum yang mengatur gerakan tersebut didasarkan pada distribusi api di lautan api dan arus di dalamnya.",
  "Aku menyimpulkannya dari pengamatan selama ratusan tahun.\"",
  "",
  "\"Bisakah bola ini menyusut dan memuai?\"",
  "",
  "\"Tentu saja.",
  "Saat ini bola sedang menyusut perlahan.\"",
  "",
  "Wang menggunakan pegangan tangan di tepi peron sebagai referensi visual tetap.",
  "Dia mendapati pernyataan Mozi itu benar.",
  "",
  "\"Dan ada cangkang dalam di dalam bola ini?\"",
  "",
  "\"Tentu saja.",
  "Cangkang dalam bergerak di dalam cangkang luar melalui serangkaian mekanisme rumit lainnya.\"",
  "",
  "\"Benar-benar mesin yang dirancang dengan terampil!\"",
  "Pujian Wang tulus.",
  "\"Tapi aku tidak melihat lubang besar di cangkang luar untuk memancarkan cahaya matahari ke cangkang dalam.\"",
  "",
  "\"Tidak ada lubang.",
  "Di permukaan dalam cangkang luar, aku telah memasang sumber cahaya untuk menyimulasikan lubang tersebut.",
  "Sumber cahaya itu terbuat dari bahan luminesens yang dikumpulkan dari ratusan ribu kunang-kunang.",
  "Aku menggunakan cahaya dingin karena cangkang dalam terbuat dari plester tembus pandang, yang bukan konduktor panas yang baik.",
  "Dengan cara ini, aku bisa menghindari masalah akumulasi panas berlebih di dalam bola yang akan terjadi dengan sumber cahaya biasa.",
  "Pengamat kemudian bisa tinggal di dalam untuk waktu yang lama.\"",
  "",
  "\"Ada orang di dalam bola itu?\"",
  "",
  "\"Ya.",
  "Seorang juru tulis berdiri di atas rak dengan dasar beroda yang dijaga tetap berada di pusat bola.",
  "Setelah kami mengatur model alam semesta agar sesuai dengan keadaan alam semesta nyata saat ini, gerakan model setelahnya seharusnya menjadi simulasi akurat masa depan, termasuk gerakan matahari.",
  "Setelah juru tulis mencatat pergerakan matahari, kami akan memiliki kalender yang presisi.",

  "Wang mengarahkan teleskop ke matahari, yang kini berada di tengah langit.",
  "Dia terkesan dengan imajinasi Mozi.",
  "Matahari memang tampak seperti lubang yang melaluinya lautan api bisa terlihat, sebuah pandangan kecil ke dalam keseluruhan yang jauh lebih besar.",
  "",
  "Namun saat dia memeriksa citra di teleskop dengan lebih teliti, dia menyadari bahwa matahari itu berbeda dari matahari yang biasa dia lihat di kehidupan nyata.",
  "Matahari di sini memiliki inti kecil.",
  "Dia membayangkan matahari sebagai sebuah mata.",
  "Inti itu seperti pupil mata, dan meskipun kecil, inti itu terang dan padat.",
  "Lapisan-lapisan yang mengelilinginya, sebaliknya, tampak tidak substansial, tipis, dan bergas.",
  "Fakta bahwa dia bisa melihat menembus lapisan luar hingga ke inti menunjukkan bahwa lapisan-lapisan itu transparan atau tembus cahaya, dan cahaya dari lapisan-lapisan itu kemungkinan hanyalah cahaya yang tersebar dari inti.",
  "",
  "Detail dalam citra matahari itu membuat Wang tercengang.",
  "Dia sekali lagi yakin bahwa perancang gim telah menyembunyikan sejumlah besar data di dalam gambar-gambar yang tampak sederhana di permukaan, hanya menunggu untuk diungkap oleh para pemain.",
  "",
  "Saat Wang merenungkan makna struktur matahari, dia menjadi bersemangat.",
  "Karena waktu dalam permainan kini berjalan cepat, matahari sudah berada di barat.",
  "Wang berdiri, menyesuaikan teleskop untuk membidik matahari lagi, dan melacaknya sampai terbenam di bawah cakrawala.",
  "",
  "Malam turun, dan api unggun di seluruh dataran mencerminkan langit yang penuh bintang.",
  "Wang melepas filter kaca asap dan terus memindai langit.",
  "Dia paling tertarik pada bintang terbang, dan tak lama kemudian menemukan dua.",

  "Ye wasn’t given a real job immediately after entering Red Coast Base.",
  "Under the watchful eyes of a security guard, she was only allowed to perform a few technical tasks.",
  "",
  "Back when she was still a second-year in college, Ye had already known the professor who would end up being her thesis advisor.",
  "He had told Ye that to do astrophysics research, it was useless to excel at theory without knowledge of experimental methods and observational skills—at least, that was true in China.",
  "This was very different from her father’s view, but Ye tended to agree with her professor.",
  "She had always felt that her father was too theoretical.",
  "",
  "Her advisor was one of the pioneers of Chinese radio astronomy.",
  "Under his influence, Ye developed a great interest in radio astronomy as well.",
  "Thus, she taught herself electrical engineering and computer science, the foundation for experiments and observations in the field.",
  "During the two years when she was a graduate student, the two of them had tested China’s first small-scale radio telescope and had accumulated a great deal of experience in the area.",
  "",
  "She hadn’t expected the knowledge would one day be useful at Red Coast Base.",
  "",
  "Eventually, Ye was assigned to the Transmission Department to maintain and repair equipment.",
  "She quickly became an indispensable part of their operations.",
  "",
  "Initially, this confused her a bit.",
  "She was the only person at the base who wasn’t in a military uniform.",
  "And given her political status, everyone kept their distance.",
  "She had no way to ward off the loneliness other than devoting herself to work.",
  "However, this wasn’t enough to explain why they relied on her so much.",
  "This was, after all, a key defense project.",
  "How could the technical staff here be so mediocre that she, who had not majored in engineering and who had no real working experience, easily took over their jobs?",
  "",
  "She learned the reason soon enough.",
  "Contrary to appearances, the base’s staff was composed of the best technical officers from the Second Artillery Corps.",
  "She could study all her life and have no hope of catching up to those excellent electrical and computer engineers.",
  "But the base was remote, the conditions were poor, and the main research work of the Red Coast Project was already completed.",
  "All that was left was maintenance and operation, so there was little opportunity for achieving any interesting technical results.",
  "Most people did not want to be indispensable, because they understood that in highly classified projects like this, once someone was put into a core technical position, it would be very difficult for him to be transferred out.",
  "Thus, all of them tried to deliberately hide their technical competence as they went about their jobs.",
  "",
  "Yet, they couldn’t appear too incompetent.",
  "So if the supervisor said to go east, they would work hard to move west, purposely playing the fool.",
  "Their hope was to put the following thought into the supervisor’s head: This man is working hard, but he’s limited in his skills.",
  "There’s no point in keeping him, because he’ll only get in the way.",
  "Many really did successfully obtain transfers through this method.",
  "",
  "Under such conditions, Ye gradually became a key technician at the base.",
  "But the other reason that she could achieve this position puzzled her, and for that she could find no explanation: Red Coast Base—at least the parts that she had contact with—had no real advanced technology at all.",
  "",
  "Over time, as Ye continued to work at the Transmission Department, the restrictions on her were gradually relaxed, and even the security guard assigned to watch her was called off.",
  "She was allowed to touch most components of Red Coast’s systems, and could read the relevant technical documents.",
  "Of course, there were still areas forbidden to her.",
  "For example, she wasn’t allowed near the computer control systems.",
  "However, Ye discovered that the impact of those systems on Red Coast was far smaller than she had imagined.",
  "For instance, the Transmission Department’s computers consisted of three machines even more primitive than DJS130 (*24).",
  "They used cumbersome magnetic core memory and paper input tape, and their longest uptime did not exceed fifteen hours.",
  "She also saw that the precision of Red Coast’s targeting system was very low, probably not even on par with that of an artillery cannon.",

  "One day, Commissar Lei came to speak with Ye.",
  "By this time, Yang Weining and Lei Zhicheng had swapped places in her eyes.",
  "During those years, Yang, as the highest-ranked technical officer, did not enjoy a high political status, and outside of technical matters he had little authority.",
  "He had to be careful with his subordinates, and had to speak politely even to the sentries, lest he be deemed to have an intellectual’s resistant attitude toward thought reform and collaboration with the masses.",
  "Thus, whenever he encountered difficulties in his work, Ye became his punching bag.",

  "She was only responsible for maintaining and repairing equipment and knew nothing about Red Coast as a whole, including its operation, targets, and so on.",

  "She wasn’t even permitted to be present at the transmission.",

  "Gradualistic mode: theoretical, fundamental results are gradually applied to technology; advances accumulate until they reach a breakthrough.",
  "Recent examples include the development of space technology.",
  "",
  "Saltatory mode: theoretical, fundamental results rapidly become applied technology, leading to a technological leap.",
  "Recent examples include the appearance of atomic weapons.",
  "Until the forties, some of the foremost physicists still thought it would never be possible to release the energy of the atom.",
  "But atomic weapons then appeared within a very short period.",
  "We define a technology leap to occur when fundamental science is converted to applied technology across a great span in an extremely brief time interval.",
  "",
  "Currently, both NATO and the Warsaw Pact are intensely active in fundamental research and investing heavily in it.",
  "One or more technological leaps can occur at any time.",
  "Such an occurrence will pose a major threat to our strategic planning.",

  "“Professor Ye,” Wang Miao said, “I have a question.",
  "Back then, SETI was marginalized research.",
  "Why did the Red Coast Project have such a high security rating?”",
  "",
  "“That question was asked during the very first phases of the Red Coast Project, and continued to be asked until the end.",
  "But now you should know the answer.",
  "We can only be impressed by the foresight of the top decision-maker responsible for the Red Coast Project.”",
  "",
  "“Yes, he thought far ahead.”",
  "Wang nodded gravely.",
  "",
  "Wang knew that it was only within the last couple of years that serious and systematic consideration had been given to the question of how and to what degree human societies would be influenced by establishing contact with extraterrestrial intelligence, but the research had rapidly gained interest, and the conclusions were shocking.",
  "",
  "Naïve, idealistic hopes had been shattered.",
  "Scholars found that, contrary to the happy wishes of most people, it was not a good idea for the human race as a whole to make contact with extraterrestrials.",
  "The impact of such contact on human society would be divisive rather than uniting, and would exacerbate rather than mitigate the conflicts between different cultures.",
  "In summary, if contact were to occur, the internal divisions within Earth civilization would be magnified and likely lead to disaster.",
  "The most shocking conclusion of all was that the impact would have nothing at all to do with the degree and type of contact (unidirectional or bidirectional), or the form and degree of advancement of the alien civilization.",
  "",
  "This was the theory of “contact as symbol” proposed by sociologist Bill Mathers of RAND Corporation in his book, The 100,000-Light-Year Iron Curtain: SETI Sociology.",
  "Mathers believed that contact with an alien civilization is only a symbol or a switch.",
  "Regardless of the content of the encounter, the results would be the same.",
  "",
  "Suppose that the nature of the contact is such that only the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence is confirmed, with no other substantive information—what Mathers called elementary contact.",
  "The impact would be magnified by the lens of human mass psychology and culture until it resulted in huge, substantive influences on the progress of civilization.",
  "If such contact were monopolized by one country or political force, the significance would be comparable to an overwhelming advantage in economic and military power.",
  "",
  "“How did Red Coast end?”",
  "",
  "“You can probably guess.”",
  "",
  "Wang nodded again.",
  "Of course he understood that, had Red Coast succeeded, the world today would be very different.",
  "To comfort Ye, he said, “It’s still too early to tell if it succeeded or not.",
  "The radio waves sent out by Red Coast haven’t gone very far in the universe yet.”",
  "",
  "Ye shook her head.",
  "“The farther the signals travel, the weaker they become, and the less likely that any extraterrestrial civilization will receive them.",
  "Of course, if aliens have already detected the Earth’s existence and its oxygen-rich atmosphere and decided to focus powerful equipment specifically at us, the story would be different.",
  "But, in general, research shows that in order for extraterrestrials to detect our signals, we must broadcast at a power level equal to the energy output of a midsized star.",
  "",
  "“Soviet astrophysicist Nicolai Kardashev once proposed that civilizations can be divided into three types based on the power they can command—for communication purposes, let’s say.",
  "A Type I civilization can muster an amount of energy equivalent to the total energy output of the Earth.",
  "Based on his estimates, the energy output of the Earth is about 1015 to 1016 watts.",
  "A Type II civilization can marshal the energy equivalent to the output of a typical star—1026 watts.",
  "A Type III civilization’s communication energy can reach 1036 watts, approximately equal to the energy output of a galaxy.",
  "Civilization on Earth is currently about a Type 0.7, not even a full Type I.",
  "And the transmissions from Red Coast used only about one ten-millionth of the amount of power the Earth could muster.",
  "Our call was like the buzzing of a mosquito in the sky.",
  "No one could hear it.”",
  "",
  "“But if Kardashev’s Type II and Type III civilizations really exist, we should be able to hear them.”",
  "",
  "“We never heard anything during the twenty years that Red Coast was in operation.”",
  "",
  "“Indeed.",
  "Given Red Coast and SETI, could all our efforts ultimately have proven only one thing: In the entire universe, only the Earth has intelligent life?”",
  "",
  "Ye gave a light sigh.",
  "“Theoretically, there may never be a definitive answer to that question.",
  "But my sense, and the sense of everyone who went through Red Coast, is that that is the case.”",
  "",
  "“It’s too bad that Red Coast was decommissioned.",
  "Once it was built, it should have been kept running.",
  "It was a truly great enterprise.”",
  "",
  "“Red Coast’s decline was gradual.",
  "At the beginning of the eighties, there was a large-scale renovation.",
  "Mainly, the transmission and monitoring computer systems were partially upgraded.",
  "The transmission system was automated, and the monitoring system incorporated two IBM minicomputers.",
  "The data processing capability became far more advanced, and it was able to simultaneously monitor forty thousand channels.",
  "",
  "“But later, as people gained perspective, they had a better appreciation of the difficulty of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and the leadership lost interest in Red Coast.",
  "The first change was reducing the base’s security rating.",
  "The consensus was that the extreme secrecy around Red Coast was unnecessary, and the security detail at the base was reduced from a company to a squad, until eventually only a group of five security guards were left.",
  "Also, after that renovation, although Red Coast remained administratively within the Second Artillery Corps, management of its scientific activities was turned over to the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Astronomy Institute, and it took on some research projects that had nothing to do with the search for extraterrestrial intelligence or the military.”",
  "",
  "“I believe you achieved most of your scientific accomplishments during that time.”",
  "",
  "“Initially, Red Coast also took on some radio astronomy projects.",
  "At the time, it was the largest radio telescope in the country.",
  "Later, as other radio astronomy observatories were built, Red Coast’s research turned to the observation and analysis of solar electromagnetic activity.",
  "For this, they added a solar telescope.",
  "The mathematical model we built for solar electromagnetic activity was at the forefront of the field back then, and had many practical applications.",
  "With these later research results, the large amount invested in Red Coast had at least a little return.",
  "",
  "“Actually, much of the credit should be given to Commissar Lei.",
  "Of course he had his own agenda.",
  "He realized that as a political officer in a technical unit, his future wasn’t bright.",
  "Before joining the army, he had studied astrophysics as well, so he wanted to return to doing science.",
  "The research projects that Red Coast took on outside of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence were all due to his efforts.”",
  "",
  "“I doubt that he could have returned to technical work so easily after spending so much time as a political commissar.",
  "Back then, you still hadn’t been politically rehabilitated.",
  "It looks to me like all he did was to put his name on your research results.”",
  "",
  "Ye smiled forgivingly.",
  "“Without Lei, Red Coast Base would have been finished even earlier.",
  "After Red Coast was designated for conversion to civilian use, the military basically abandoned it.",
  "Eventually, the Chinese Academy of Sciences couldn’t maintain the funds necessary for Red Coast’s operation, and it was shut down.”",
  "",
  "Ye didn’t talk much about her daily life at Red Coast Base, and Wang didn’t ask.",
  "Four years after entering the base, she married Yang Weining.",
  "Everything just happened naturally, without any drama.",
  "Later, an accident at the base killed both Yang and Lei, and Yang Dong was born after her father’s death.",
  "The mother and daughter only left Radar Peak in the mid-eighties, when Red Coast Base was finally decommissioned.",

  "“From time to time, I would gaze up at the stars after a night shift and think that they looked like a glowing desert, and I myself was a poor child abandoned in the desert.",
  "… I thought that life was truly an accident among accidents in the universe.",
  "The universe was an empty palace, and humankind the only ant in the entire palace.",
  "This kind of thinking infused the second half of my life with a conflicted mentality: Sometimes I thought life was precious, and everything was so important; but other times I thought humans were insignificant, and nothing was worthwhile.",
  "Anyway, my life passed day after day accompanied by this strange feeling, and before I knew it, I was old.",

  "Wang tahu bahwa baru dalam beberapa tahun terakhir pertimbangan serius dan sistematis diberikan pada pertanyaan tentang bagaimana dan sejauh mana masyarakat manusia akan dipengaruhi oleh kontak dengan kecerdasan luar angkasa, tetapi penelitian itu dengan cepat menarik minat, dan kesimpulannya sangat mengejutkan.",
  "",
  "Harapan-harapan naif dan idealis telah hancur lebur.",
  "Para cendekiawan menemukan bahwa, bertentangan dengan harapan bahagia kebanyakan orang, bukanlah ide yang baik bagi umat manusia secara keseluruhan untuk melakukan kontak dengan makhluk luar angkasa.",
  "Dampak kontak semacam itu pada masyarakat manusia akan memecah belah alih-alih mempersatukan, dan akan memperburuk alih-alih meredakan konflik antara budaya yang berbeda.",
  "Singkatnya, jika kontak terjadi, perpecahan internal dalam peradaban Bumi akan membesar dan kemungkinan besar berujung pada bencana.",
  "Kesimpulan yang paling mengejutkan adalah bahwa dampak tersebut sama sekali tidak berkaitan dengan tingkat dan jenis kontak (satu arah atau dua arah), ataupun bentuk dan tingkat kemajuan peradaban asing tersebut.",
  "",
  "Ini adalah teori “kontak sebagai simbol” yang diajukan oleh sosiolog Bill Mathers dari RAND Corporation dalam bukunya, The 100,000-Light-Year Iron Curtain: SETI Sociology.",
  "Mathers meyakini bahwa kontak dengan peradaban asing hanyalah sebuah simbol atau pemicu.",
  "Terlepas dari apa isi pertemuan itu, hasilnya akan sama saja.",
  "",
  "Misalkan sifat kontaknya sedemikian rupa sehingga hanya keberadaan kecerdasan luar angkasa yang terkonfirmasi, tanpa informasi substantif lainnya—apa yang disebut Mathers sebagai kontak elementer.",
  "Dampaknya akan diperbesar oleh lensa psikologi massa dan budaya manusia hingga menghasilkan pengaruh besar yang substantif terhadap kemajuan peradaban.",
  "Jika kontak semacam itu dimonopoli oleh satu negara atau kekuatan politik, signifikansinya akan sebanding dengan keunggulan mutlak dalam kekuatan ekonomi dan militer.",
  "",
  "“Bagaimana Red Coast berakhir?”",
  "",
  "“Anda mungkin bisa menebaknya.”",
  "",
  "Wang mengangguk lagi.",
  "Tentu saja dia mengerti bahwa, seandainya Red Coast berhasil, dunia hari ini akan sangat berbeda.",
  "Untuk menghibur Ye, dia berkata, “Masih terlalu dini untuk mengatakan apakah itu berhasil atau tidak.",
  "Gelombang radio yang dikirim oleh Red Coast belum pergi terlalu jauh di alam semesta.”",
  "",
  "Ye menggeleng.",
  "“Semakin jauh sinyal merambat, semakin lemah jadinya, dan semakin kecil kemungkinan peradaban luar angkasa akan menerimanya.",
  "Tentu saja, jika alien sudah mendeteksi keberadaan Bumi dan atmosfernya yang kaya oksigen, lalu memutuskan untuk memfokuskan peralatan canggih khusus ke arah kita, ceritanya akan berbeda.",
  "Namun, secara umum, penelitian menunjukkan bahwa agar makhluk luar angkasa dapat mendeteksi sinyal kita, kita harus melakukan siaran pada tingkat daya yang setara dengan output energi sebuah bintang berukuran sedang.",
  "",
  "“Astrofisikawan Soviet, Nicolai Kardashev, pernah mengusulkan bahwa peradaban dapat dibagi menjadi tiga tipe berdasarkan daya yang dapat mereka kuasai—untuk tujuan komunikasi, katakanlah.",
  "Peradaban Tipe I dapat mengerahkan jumlah energi yang setara dengan total output energi Bumi.",
  "Berdasarkan perkiraannya, output energi Bumi adalah sekitar 10^15 hingga 10^16 watt.",
  "Peradaban Tipe II dapat mengerahkan energi yang setara dengan output bintang biasa—10^26 watt.",
  "Energi komunikasi Peradaban Tipe III dapat mencapai 10^36 watt, kira-kira setara dengan output energi sebuah galaksi.",
  "Peradaban di Bumi saat ini kira-kira Tipe 0,7, bahkan belum mencapai Tipe I penuh.",

  "Pada awal tahun delapan puluhan, ada renovasi besar-besaran.",
  "Utamanya, sistem komputer transmisi dan pemantauan ditingkatkan sebagian.",
  "Sistem transmisi diotomatisasi, dan sistem pemantauan menggabungkan dua komputer mini IBM.",

  "",
  "“Tapi kemudian, seiring orang-orang mendapatkan perspektif yang lebih luas, mereka lebih menghargai betapa sulitnya pencarian kecerdasan luar angkasa, dan para pimpinan kehilangan minat pada Red Coast.",
  "Perubahan pertama adalah penurunan tingkat keamanan pangkalan.",
  "Konsensusnya adalah bahwa kerahasiaan ekstrem di sekitar Red Coast tidak diperlukan, dan detail keamanan di pangkalan dikurangi dari satu kompi menjadi satu regu, hingga akhirnya hanya tersisa sekelompok lima penjaga keamanan.",
  "Selain itu, setelah renovasi tersebut, meskipun secara administratif Red Coast tetap berada di bawah Korps Artileri Kedua, manajemen kegiatan ilmiahnya diserahkan ke Institut Astronomi Akademi Ilmu Pengetahuan Tiongkok, dan pangkalan itu mengambil beberapa proyek penelitian yang tidak ada hubungannya dengan pencarian kecerdasan luar angkasa ataupun militer.”",

  "Untuk ini, mereka menambahkan teleskop surya.",

  "It had a Gothic-style apex, stabbing straight into the morning sky, recalling St. Joseph’s Church at Wangfujing.",
  "But if that church were placed next to this pyramid, it would be nothing more than an entrance booth.",
  "He saw many buildings in the distance that were apparently dehydratories, but also now built in the Gothic style, with tall, sharp steeples, as though the ground had grown numerous spikes.",
  "",
  "Wang saw a door on the side of the pyramid, lit from within by flickering lights.",
  "He walked over.",
  "Inside the tunnel was a row of statues of the gods of Olympus holding up torches, their surfaces blackened by smoke.",
  "He entered the Great Hall and saw that it was even dimmer than the entrance tunnel.",
  "Two silver candelabra on top of a long marble table provided a drowsy light.",
  "",
  "Several men were seated around the table.",
  "The dim light allowed Wang to see only the outlines of their faces.",
  "Their eyes were hidden in the shadows of their deep eye sockets, but Wang could still feel their gazes focusing on him.",
  "The men seemed to be dressed in medieval robes.",
  "On closer examination, one or two of them had simpler robes, more like Classical Greek chitons.",
  "At one end of the table was a thin, tall man.",
  "The golden crown on top of his head was the only thing that glittered in the Great Hall other than the candles.",
  "With some effort, Wang saw by the dim candlelight that his robe was different from the others’: it was red.",
  "",
  "Wang realized that the game displayed a distinct world for each player.",
  "This world, based on the European High Middle Ages, was chosen by the software based on his ID.",
  "",
  "“You’re late.",
  "The meeting has been going on for a while,” the gold-crowned, red-robed man said.",
  "“I’m Pope Gregory.”",
  "",
  "Wang tried to recall what little he knew of European history in the Middle Ages so that he could deduce the level of advancement of this civilization based on the name.",
  "But then he remembered how wildly anachronistic historical references could be in the world of Three Body and decided the effort wasn’t worth it.",
  "",
  "“I’m Aristotle.",
  "You changed your ID, but we all recognize you.",
  "In the previous two civilizations, you traveled to the East.”",
  "The speaker was the man with the Greek chiton.",
  "He had a head of white curls.",
  "",
  "“Yes.”",
  "Wang nodded.",
  "“There, I witnessed the destruction of two civilizations, one by extreme cold, another by a blazing sun.",
  "I also saw the great efforts the scholars of the East expended in trying to master the laws governing the sun’s motion.”",
  "",
  "“Ha!”",
  "The sound came from a man with a goatee that curled upward.",
  "He was even thinner than the pope.",
  "“Eastern scholars tried to understand the secrets of the sun’s motion through meditation, epiphany, or even dreams.",
  "Utterly laughable!”",
  "",
  "“This is Galileo,” said Aristotle.",
  "“He advocates understanding the world through observation and experiment.",
  "He is an unimaginative thinker, but his results demand our attention.”",
  "",
  "“Mozi also conducted experiments and observation,” Wang said.",
  "",
  "Galileo snorted.",
  "“Mozi’s way of thinking was still Eastern.",
  "He was nothing more than a mystic dressed as a scientist.",
  "He never took his own observation data seriously, and he constructed his model based on subjective speculation.",
  "Ridiculous!",
  "I feel sorry for his refined equipment.",
  "We’re different.",
  "Based on large amounts of observational data and experiments, we make strict, logical deductions to build a model of the universe.",
  "Then we go back to experimentation and observation to test it.”",
  "",
  "“That’s correct.”",
  "Wang nodded.",
  "“That’s also my way of thinking.”",
  "",
  "“Have you brought a calendar as well, then?”",
  "The pope’s tone was mocking.",
  "",
  "“I don’t have a calendar.",
  "I only brought a model built upon observation data.",
  "But I must make it clear that even if the model is correct, it’s not certain that by using it one can master the precise details of the sun’s motion and create a calendar.",
  "However, it’s a necessary step.”",
  "",
  "A few lonely claps echoed throughout the Great Hall.",
  "The applause came from Galileo.",
  "“Excellent, Copernicus, excellent.",
  "Your pragmatic way of thinking, adapted to the experimental, scientific approach, is lacking in most scholars.",
  "Based on this alone, your theory is worth listening to.”",
  "",
  "The pope nodded at Wang.",
  "“Go ahead.”",
  "",
  "After calming himself and walking to the other end of the long table, Wang said, “It’s actually pretty simple.",
  "The reason why the sun’s motion seems patternless is because our world has three suns.",
  "Under the influence of their mutually perturbing gravitational attraction, their movements are unpredictable—the three-body problem.",
  "When our planet revolves around one of the suns in a stable orbit, that’s a Stable Era.",
  "When one or more of the other suns move within a certain distance, their gravitational pull will snatch the planet away from the sun it’s orbiting, causing it to wander unstably through the gravitational fields of the three suns.",
  "That’s a Chaotic Era.",
  "After an uncertain amount of time, our planet is once again pulled into a temporary orbit and another Stable Era begins.",
  "This is a football game at the scale of the universe.",
  "The players are the three suns, and our planet is the football.”",
  "",
  "A few hollow laughs rang out in the Great Hall.",
  "“Burn him to death,” the pope said impassively.",
  "The two soldiers standing at the door in rusty armor started toward Wang like two clumsy robots.",
  "",
  "“Burn him.”",
  "Galileo sighed.",
  "“I had hopes for you, but you’re nothing more than another mystic or warlock.”",
  "",
  "“Such men are a public nuisance,” Aristotle agreed.",
  "",
  "“At least let me finish!”",
  "Wang shoved away the iron gauntlets of the two soldiers.",
  "",
  "“Have you seen three suns?",
  "Or know anyone who has?”",
  "Galileo asked.",
  "",
  "“Everyone has seen them.”",
  "",
  "“Then, other than the sun that appears during Chaotic Eras and Stable Eras, where are the other two?”",
  "",
  "“The sun that we see at different times may not be the same: It’s only one of the three suns.",
  "When the other two are far away, they look like flying stars.”",
  "",
  "“You lack basic scientific training,” Galileo said, shaking his head.",
  "“The sun must move continuously to a distant spot.",
  "It cannot jump over the intervening space.",
  "According to your hypothesis, there should be another observable situation: The sun must get smaller than it usually appears but bigger than a flying star, and gradually shrink into a flying star as it moves farther away.",
  "But we’ve never seen the sun behave that way.”",
  "",
  "“Since you have scientific training, you ought to have some knowledge of the sun’s structure.”",
  "",
  "“That’s my proudest discovery.",
  "The sun is made of a sparse but expansive gaseous outer layer and a dense and hot inner core.”",
  "",
  "“Very true,” said Wang.",
  "“But you apparently haven’t discovered the special optical interaction between the sun’s gaseous outer layer and our planet’s atmosphere.",
  "It’s a phenomenon akin to polarization or destructive interference.",
  "As a result, when we view the sun from within our atmosphere and it gets a certain distance from us, the gaseous outer layer suddenly becomes completely transparent and invisible, and all we can see is its bright inner core.",
  "The sun then appears to be only the size of the inner core, a flying star.",
  "",
  "“This phenomenon has confused every researcher in every civilization throughout history, and prevented them from discovering the existence of the three suns.",
  "Now you understand why the appearance of three flying stars heralds a long period of extreme cold: because all three suns are far away.”",
  "",
  "A brief silence followed as everyone pondered this.",
  "Aristotle was the first to speak.",
  "“You lack basic training in logic.",
  "It’s true that we can sometimes see three flying stars, and that’s always accompanied by destructive periods of extreme cold.",
  "But based on your theory, we should also sometimes see three normal-sized suns in the sky.",
  "This has never happened.",
  "In all the records of all the civilizations, this has never occurred!”",
  "",
  "“Wait!”",
  "A man wearing a strangely shaped hat and a long beard stood up and spoke for the first time.",
  "“I’m Leonardo da Vinci.",
  "There may be such historical records.",
  "One civilization saw two suns and was immediately destroyed by their combined heat, but the record was very vague.”",
  "",
  "“We’re talking about three suns, not two!”",
  "Galileo shouted.",
  "“According to his theory, three suns must appear sometime, just like three flying stars.”",
  "",
  "“Three suns have appeared,” Wang said, utterly calm.",
  "“And people have seen them.",
  "But those who saw such a great sight could not leave behind any information about them because seeing three suns would mean that they had at most a few seconds left to live.",
  "They had no chance to escape or survive.",
  "Tri-solar days are the most terrifying catastrophes for our world.",
  "On such days, the surface of the planet would turn into a smelting furnace in a second, and the heat would be enough to melt rocks.",
  "After the destruction caused by a tri-solar day, an eon would pass before the reappearance of life and civilization.",
  "This is yet another reason why there’s no historical record of them.”",
  "",
  "Silence.",
  "Everyone stared at the pope.",

  "The smile on his face was a little familiar to Wang: the smile of King Zhou of Shang.",
  "",
  "The Great Hall came alive, and everyone seemed to be preparing for a celebration.",
  "Galileo and some others joyfully carried a stake out of a dark corner.",
  "They pulled off the charcoal-black body still tied to the stake and cast it aside before fastening it in an upright position.",
  "Another group happily piled firewood around the stake.",
  "Only Leonardo ignored the commotion.",
  "He sat at the table, pondering, and occasionally using a pen to calculate something on the table.",
  "",
  "“Giordano Bruno,” Aristotle said, pointing at the blackened body.",
  "“Like you, he came here and spewed nonsense.”",

  "As for the rest of you, you’re either programs or idiots.",
  "I will log back on!”",
  "",
  "“You cannot return.",
  "You will disappear forever from the world of Three Body.”",
  "Galileo cackled.",
  "",
  "“Then you must be a program.",
  "A normal person would certainly understand the basics of the Internet.",
  "The most the game can do is record my MAC address.",
  "I can just switch computers and create a new ID.",

  "As he was about to light the firewood piled around Wang, a bright red light filled the entrance tunnel, followed by a wave of heat and smoke.",
  "A horse dashed out of the light and into the Great Hall.",

  "Wang looked up and saw three gigantic suns slowly spinning around an invisible origin, like an immense three-bladed fan blowing a deadly wind toward the world below.",

  "Wang arrived at Da Shi’s chaotic office and saw that it was already filled with a dense cloud of cigarette smoke.",
  "A young woman police officer who shared the office fanned the smoke away from her nose with a notebook.",

  "WEI CHENG’S STORY",
  "",
  "I’ve been lackadaisical since I was a kid.",
  "When I lived at boarding school, I never washed the dishes or made the bed.",
  "I never got excited about anything.",
  "Too lazy to study, too lazy to even play, I dawdled my way through the days without any clear goals.",
  "",
  "But I knew that I had some special talents others lacked.",
  "For example, if you drew a line, I could always draw another line that would divide it into the golden ratio: 1.618.",
  "My classmates told me that I should be a carpenter, but I thought it was more than that, a kind of intuition about numbers and shapes.",
  "But my math grades were just as bad as my grades in other classes.",
  "I was too lazy to bother showing my work.",
  "On tests, I just wrote out my guesses as answers.",
  "I got them right about eighty to ninety percent of the time, but I still got mediocre scores.",
  "",
  "When I was a second-year student in high school, a math teacher noticed me.",
  "Back then, many high school teachers had impressive academic credentials, because during the Cultural Revolution many talented scholars ended up teaching in high schools.",
  "My teacher was like that.",
  "",
  "One day, he kept me after class.",
  "He wrote out a dozen or so numerical sequences on the blackboard and asked me to write out the summation formula for each.",
  "I wrote out the formulas for some of them almost instantaneously and could tell at a glance that the rest of them were divergent.",
  "",
  "My teacher took out a book, The Collected Cases of Sherlock Holmes.",
  "He turned to one story— “A Study in Scarlet,” I think.",
  "There’s a scene in it where Watson sees a plainly dressed messenger downstairs and points him out to Holmes.",
  "Holmes says, “Oh, you mean the retired sergeant of marines?”",
  "Watson is amazed by how Holmes could deduce the man’s history, but Holmes can’t articulate his reasoning and has to think for a while to figure out his chain of deductions.",
  "It was based on the man’s hand, his movements, and so on.",
  "He tells Watson that there is nothing strange about this: Most people would have difficulty explaining how they know two and two make four.",
  "",
  "My teacher closed the book and said to me, “You’re just like that.",
  "Your derivation is so fast and instinctive that you can’t even tell how you got the answer.”",
  "Then he asked me, “When you see a string of numbers, what do you feel?",
  "I’m talking about feelings.”",
  "",
  "I said, “Any combination of numbers appears to me as a three-dimensional shape.",
  "Of course I can’t describe the shapes of numbers, but they really do appear as shapes.”",
  "",
  "“Then what about when you see geometric figures?”",
  "The teacher asked.",
  "",
  "I said, “It’s just the opposite.",
  "In my mind there are no geometric figures.",
  "Everything turns into numbers.",
  "It’s just like if you get really close to a picture in the newspaper and everything turns into little dots.”",
  "",
  "The teacher said, “You really have a natural gift for math, but … but…” He added a few more “but”s, pacing back and forth as though I was a difficult problem that he didn’t know how to handle.",
  "“But people like you don’t cherish your gift.”",
  "After thinking for a while, he seemed to give up, saying, “Why don’t you sign up for the district math competition next month?",
  "I’m not going to tutor you.",
  "I’d just be wasting my time with your sort.",
  "But when you give your answers, make sure to write out your derivations.”",
  "",
  "So I went to the competition.",
  "From the district level up through the International Mathematics Olympiad in Budapest, I won first place each time.",
  "After I got back, I was accepted by a top college’s math program without having to go through the entrance examination.",
  "…",
  "",
  "You’re not bored by my talking all this time?",
  "Ah, good.",
  "Well, to make sense of what happened later, I have to tell you all this.",
  "That high school math teacher was right.",
  "I didn’t cherish my talent.",
  "Bachelor’s, master’s, Ph.D.—I never put much effort into any of them, but I did manage to get through them all.",
  "However, once I graduated and went back to the real world, I realized that I was completely useless.",
  "Other than math, I knew nothing.",
  "I was half asleep when it came to the complexities of relationships between people.",
  "The longer I worked, the worse my career.",
  "Eventually I became a lecturer at a college, but I couldn’t survive there either.",
  "I just couldn’t take teaching seriously.",
  "I’d write on the blackboard, “easy to prove,” and my students would still struggle for a long while.",
  "Later, when they began to eliminate the worst teachers, I was fired.",
  "",
  "By then I was sick of everything.",
  "I packed a bag and went to a Buddhist temple deep in the mountains somewhere in southern China.",
  "",
  "Oh, I didn’t go to become a monk.",
  "Too lazy for that.",
  "I just wanted to find a truly peaceful place to live for a while.",
  "The abbot there was my father’s old friend—very intellectual, but became a monk in his old age.",
  "The way my father told it, at his level, this was about the only way out.",
  "The abbot asked me to stay.",
  "I told him, “I want to find a peaceful, easy way to just muddle through the rest of my life.”",
  "The abbot said, “This place isn’t really peaceful.",
  "There are lots of tourists, and many pilgrims too.",
  "The truly peaceful can find peace in a bustling city.",
  "And to attain that state, you need to empty yourself.”",
  "I said, “I’m empty enough.",
  "Fame and fortune are nothing to me.",
  "Many of the monks in this temple are worldlier than me.”",
  "The abbot shook his head and said, “No, emptiness is not nothingness.",
  "Emptiness is a type of existence.",
  "You must use this existential emptiness to fill yourself.”",
  "",
  "His words were very enlightening to me.",
  "Later, after I thought about it a bit, I realized that it wasn’t Buddhist philosophy at all, but was more akin to some modern physics theories.",
  "The abbot also told me he wasn’t going to discuss Buddhism with me.",
  "His reason was the same as my high school teacher’s: With my sort, he’d just be wasting his time.",
  "",
  "That first night, I couldn’t sleep in the tiny room in the temple.",
  "I didn’t realize that this refuge from the world would be so uncomfortable.",
  "My blanket and sheet both became damp in the mountain fog, and the bed was so hard.",
  "In order to make myself sleep, I tried to follow the abbot’s advice and fill myself with “emptiness.”",
  "",
  "In my mind, the first “emptiness” I created was the infinity of space.",
  "There was nothing in it, not even light.",
  "But soon I knew that this empty universe could not make me feel peace.",
  "Instead, it filled me with a nameless anxiety, like a drowning man wanting to grab on to anything at hand.",
  "",
  "So I created a sphere in this infinite space for myself: not too big, though possessing mass.",
  "My mental state didn’t improve, however.",
  "The sphere floated in the middle of “emptiness”—in infinite space, anywhere could be the middle.",
  "The universe had nothing that could act on it, and it could act on nothing.",
  "It hung there, never moving, never changing, like a perfect interpretation for death.",
  "",
  "I created a second sphere whose mass was equal to the first one’s.",
  "Both had perfectly reflective surfaces.",
  "They reflected each other’s images, displaying the only existence in the universe other than itself.",
  "But the situation didn’t improve much.",
  "If the spheres had no initial movement—that is, if I didn’t push them at first—they would be quickly pulled together by their own gravitational attraction.",
  "Then the two spheres would stay together and hang there without moving, a symbol for death.",
  "If they did have initial movement and didn’t collide, then they would revolve around each other under the influence of gravity.",
  "No matter what the initial conditions, the revolutions would eventually stabilize and become unchanging: the dance of death.",
  "",
  "I then introduced a third sphere, and to my astonishment, the situation changed completely.",
  "Like I said, any geometric figure turns into numbers in the depths of my mind.",
  "The sphereless, one-sphere, and two-sphere universes all showed up as a single equation or a few equations, like a few lonesome leaves in late fall.",
  "But this third sphere gave “emptiness” life.",
  "The three spheres, given initial movements, went through complex, seemingly never-repeating movements.",
  "The descriptive equations rained down in a thunderstorm without end.",
  "",
  "Just like that, I fell asleep.",
  "The three spheres continued to dance in my dream, a patternless, never-repeating dance.",
  "Yet, in the depths of my mind, the dance did possess a rhythm; it was just that its period of repetition was infinitely long.",
  "This mesmerized me.",
  "I wanted to describe the whole period, or at least a part of it.",
  "",
  "The next day I kept on thinking about the three spheres dancing in “emptiness.”",
  "My attention had never been so completely engaged.",
  "It got to the point where one of the monks asked the abbot whether I was having mental health issues.",
  "The abbot laughed and said, “Don’t worry.",
  "He has found emptiness.”",
  "Yes, I had found emptiness.",
  "Now I could be at peace in a bustling city.",
  "Even in the midst of a noisy crowd, my heart would be completely tranquil.",
  "For the first time, I enjoyed math.",
  "I felt like a libertine who has always fluttered carelessly from one woman to another suddenly finding himself in love.",
  "",
  "The physics principles behind the three-body problem (*28) are very simple.",
  "It’s mainly a math problem.",
  "",
  "*28- Author’s Note: How three bodies would move under the influence of their mutual gravitational attractions is a traditional problem in classical mechanics that arises naturally in the study of celestial mechanics.",
  "Many have worked on it since the sixteenth century.",
  "Euler, Lagrange, and more recent researchers (aided by computers) have all found solutions for special cases of the three-body problem.",
  "Karl F.",
  "Sundman later proved the existence of a general solution to the three-body problem in the form of a convergent infinite series, but the series converges so slowly that it is practically useless.",
  "",
  "“Didn’t you know about Henri Poincaré?”",
  "Wang Miao interrupted Wei to ask (*29).",
  "",
  "*29- Translator’s Note: Poincaré showed that the three-body problem exhibited sensitive dependence on initial conditions, which we would now understand as characteristic of chaotic behavior.",
  "",
  "At the time, I didn’t.",
  "Yes, I know that someone studying math should know about a master like Poincaré, but I didn’t worship masters and I didn’t want to become one, so I didn’t know his work.",
  "But even if I had, I would have continued to pursue the three-body problem.",
  "",
  "Everyone seems to believe that Poincaré proved that the three-body problem couldn’t be solved, but I think they’re mistaken.",
  "He only proved sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and that the three-body system couldn’t be solved by integrals.",
  "But sensitivity is not the same as being completely indeterminable.",
  "It’s just that the solution contains a greater number of different forms.",
  "What’s needed is a new algorithm.",
  "",
  "Back then, I thought of one thing: Have you heard of the Monte Carlo method?",
  "Ah, it’s a computer algorithm often used for calculating the area of irregular shapes.",
  "Specifically, the software puts the figure of interest in a figure of known area, such as a circle, and randomly strikes it with many tiny balls, never targeting the same spot twice.",
  "After a large number of balls, the proportion of balls that fall within the irregular shape compared to the total number of balls used to hit the circle will yield the area of the shape.",
  "Of course, the smaller the balls used, the more accurate the result.",
  "",
  "Although the method is simple, it shows how, mathematically, random brute force can overcome precise logic.",
  "It’s a numerical approach that uses quantity to derive quality.",
  "This is my strategy for solving the three-body problem.",
  "I study the system moment by moment.",
  "At each moment, the spheres’ motion vectors can combine in infinite ways.",
  "I treat each combination like a life form.",
  "The key is to set up some rules: which combinations of motion vectors are “healthy” and “beneficial,” and which combinations are “detrimental” and “harmful.”",
  "The former receive a survival advantage while the latter are disfavored.",
  "The computation proceeds by eliminating the disadvantaged and preserving the advantaged.",
  "The final combination that survives is the correct prediction for the system’s next configuration, the next moment in time.",
  "",
  "“It’s an evolutionary algorithm,” Wang said.",
  "",
  "“It’s a good thing I invited you along.”",
  "Shi Qiang nodded at Wang.",
  "",
  "Yes.",
  "Only much later did I learn that term.",
  "The distinguishing feature of this algorithm is that it requires ultralarge amounts of computing power.",
  "For the three-body problem, the computers we have now aren’t enough.",
  "",
  "Back then, in the temple, I didn’t even have a calculator.",
  "I had to go to the accounting office to get a blank ledger and a pencil.",
  "I began to build the math model on paper.",
  "This required a lot of work, and in no time at all I went through more than a dozen ledgers.",
  "The monks in charge of accounts were angry with me, but because the abbot wished it, they found me more paper and pen.",
  "I hid the completed calculations under my pillow, and threw the scratch paper into the incense burner in the yard.",
  "",
  "One evening, a young woman suddenly dashed into my room.",
  "This was the first time a woman had shown up at my place.",
  "She clutched a few pieces of paper with burnt edges, the scratch paper I had thrown out.",
  "",
  "“They tell me these are yours.",
  "Are you studying the three-body problem?”",
  "Behind her wide glasses, her eyes seemed to be on fire.",
  "",
  "The woman surprised me.",
  "The math I used was unconventional, and my derivations took large leaps.",
  "But the fact that she could tell the subject of my study from a few pieces of scratch paper showed that she had unusual math talent and that she, like me, was very devoted to the three-body problem.",
  "",
  "I didn’t have a good impression of the tourists and pilgrims.",
  "The tourists had no idea what they were looking at, only running around to snap pictures.",
  "As for the pilgrims, they looked much poorer than the tourists, and all seemed to be in a state of numbness, their intellect inhibited.",
  "But this woman was different.",
  "She looked like an academic.",
  "Later I found out that she had come with a group of Japanese tourists.",
  "",
  "Without waiting for my answer, she added, “Your approach is brilliant.",
  "We’ve been searching for a method like this that could turn the difficulty of the three-body problem into a matter of massive computation.",
  "Of course, it would require a very powerful computer.”",
  "",
  "I told her the truth.",
  "“Even if we were to use all the computers in the world, it wouldn’t be enough.”",
  "",
  "“But you must have an adequate research environment, and there’s nothing like that here.",
  "I can give you the use of a supercomputer.",
  "I can also give you a minicomputer.",
  "Let’s leave together tomorrow morning.”",
  "",
  "The woman, of course, was Shen Yufei.",
  "Like now, she was concise and authoritarian, but she was more attractive then.",
  "I’m naturally a cold person.",
  "I had less interest in women than the monks around me.",
  "This woman who didn’t adhere to conventional ideas about femininity was different, though.",
  "She attracted me.",
  "Since I had nothing to do anyway, I agreed right away.",
  "",
  "That night, I couldn’t sleep.",
  "I draped a shirt over my shoulders and walked out into the yard.",
  "In the distance, I saw Shen in the dim temple hall.",
  "She knelt before the Buddha with lit joss sticks, and all her movements seemed full of piety.",
  "I approached noiselessly, and as I came by the door to the temple hall, I heard her whisper a prayer: “Buddha, please help my Lord break away from the sea of misery.”",
  "",
  "I thought I must have heard wrong, but she chanted the prayer again.",
  "",
  "“Buddha, please help my Lord break away from the sea of misery.”",

  "I didn’t understand religion and had no interest in any of them, but I really couldn’t think of any prayer odder than this one.",
  "“What are you saying?”",
  "I blurted.",
  "",
  "Shen ignored me.",
  "She kept her eyes barely closed, her hands clasped together in front of her, as though watching her prayer rise with the incense smoke toward the Buddha.",
  "After a long while, she finally opened her eyes and turned toward me.",
  "“Go to sleep.",
  "We have to get up early.”",

  "Shen said nothing, just hurried away.",
  "I didn’t get a chance to ask anything else.",
  "I repeated the prayer to myself over and over, and it seemed to grow even stranger.",
  "Eventually, I became frightened.",
  "I rushed over to the abbot’s room and knocked on his door.",

  "“What does it mean if someone prays to the Buddha to help another Lord?”",
  "I then told him the details of what I saw.",

  "Then he said, “Please leave me for a bit.",
  "Let me think.”",
  "",
  "I turned and left, knowing that it was unusual.",
  "The abbot was very learned.",
  "Usually, he could answer any question about religion, history, and culture without having to think.",
  "I waited outside the door for about the time it took to smoke a cigarette, and the abbot called for me.",
  "",
  "“I think there’s only one possibility.”",
  "His expression was grim.",
  "",
  "“What?",
  "What could it be?",
  "Could there be some religion whose god needs worshippers to pray to the gods of other religions to save it?”",
  "",
  "“Her Lord really exists.”",

  "This response confused me.",
  "“Then … the Buddha doesn’t exist?”",
  "As soon as I said it I realized how rude it sounded.",
  "I apologized.",
  "",
  "The abbot slowly waved his hand at me.",
  "“I told you, the two of us can’t talk about Buddhism.",
  "The existence of the Buddha is a kind of existence that you cannot comprehend.",
  "But the Lord she’s talking about exists in a way that you can understand.",
  "… I can say no more concerning this matter.",
  "All I can do is counsel you against leaving with her.”",

  "“It’s just a feeling.",

  "I left the abbot’s room and walked through the temple toward my room.",
  "The night had a full moon.",
  "I looked up at it and thought it a silvery, strange eye that gazed down at me, the light suffused with an eerie chill.",
  "",
  "The next day, I did leave with Shen—I couldn’t stay in the temple the rest of my life, after all.",
  "But I didn’t think that over the next few years, I would live the life of my dreams.",
  "Shen fulfilled her promise.",
  "I had a minicomputer and a comfortable environment.",
  "I even left the country several times to use supercomputers—not time-sharing, but having the whole CPU to myself.",
  "She had a lot of money, though I didn’t know where it came from.",

  "In her house, I was taken care of and did not have to worry about food or clothing, so that I could devote myself to the study of the three-body problem.",
  "Shen never interfered with my life.",
  "The garage had a car that I could drive anywhere.",

  "The location for the Three Body players’ meet-up was a small, out-of-the-way coffee shop.",
  "Wang had always imagined game meet-ups would be lively events full of people, but this meet-up consisted of only seven players, including himself.",
  "Like Wang, the other six did not look like gaming enthusiasts.",
  "Only two were relatively young.",
  "Another three, including a woman, were middle-aged.",
  "There was also an old man who appeared to be in his sixties or seventies.",
  "",
  "Wang had originally thought that as soon as they met they’d begin a lively discussion of Three Body, but he was wrong.",
  "The profound but strange content of Three Body had had a psychological impact on the participants.",
  "All the players, including Wang himself, couldn’t bring it up easily.",
  "They only made simple self-introductions.",
  "The old man took out a refined pipe, filled it with tobacco, and smoked as he strolled around, admiring the paintings on the walls.",
  "The others sat silently, waiting for the meet-up organizer to show up.",
  "They had all come early.",
  "",
  "Actually, of the six, Wang already knew two.",
  "The old man was a famous scholar who had made his name by imbuing Eastern philosophy with the content of modern science.",
  "The strangely dressed woman was a famous writer, one of those rare novelists who wrote in an avant-garde style but still had many readers.",
  "You could start one of her books on any page.",
  "",
  "Of the two middle-aged men, one was a vice president at China’s largest software company, plainly and casually dressed so that his status wasn’t obvious at all; and the other was a high-level executive at the State Power Corporation.",
  "Of the two young men, one was a reporter with a major media outlet, and the other was a doctoral student in the sciences.",
  "Wang now realized that a considerable number of Three Body players were probably social elites like them.",
  "",
  "The meet-up organizer showed up not long after.",
  "Wang’s heart began to beat faster as soon as he saw the man: it was Pan Han, prime suspect for the murder of Shen Yufei.",
  "He took out his phone when no one was looking and texted Shi Qiang.",
  "",
  "“Haha, everyone got here early!”",
  "Pan greeted them in a relaxed manner, as though nothing was wrong.",
  "Appearing in the media, he usually looked disheveled, like a vagrant, but today, he was dressed sharply in a suit and dress shoes.",
  "“You’re just like I imagined.",
  "Three Body is intended for people in your class because the common crowd cannot appreciate its meaning and mood.",
  "To play it well requires knowledge and understanding that ordinary people do not possess.”",
  "",
  "Wang sent out his text: Spotted Pan Han.",
  "At Yunhe Coffee Shop in Xicheng District.",
  "",
  "Pan continued.",
  "“Everyone here is an excellent Three Body player.",
  "You have the best scores and are devoted to it.",
  "I believe that Three Body is already an important part of your lives.”",
  "",
  "“It’s part of what keeps me alive,” the young doctoral student said.",
  "",
  "“I saw it by accident on my grandson’s computer,” the old philosopher said, lifting his pipe stem.",
  "“The young man abandoned it after a few tries, saying it was too abstruse.",
  "But I was attracted to it.",
  "I find it strange, terrible, but also beautiful.",
  "So much information is hidden beneath a simple representation.”",
  "",
  "A few players nodded at this description, including Wang himself.",
  "",
  "Wang received Da Shi’s reply text: We also see him.",
  "No worries.",
  "Carry on.",
  "Play the fanatic in front of them, but not so much that you can’t pull it off.",
  "",
  "“Yes,” the author agreed, and nodded.",
  "“I like the literary elements of Three Body.",
  "The rises and falls of two hundred and three civilizations evoke the qualities of epics in a new form.”",
  "",
  "She mentioned 203 civilizations, but Wang had only experienced 184.",
  "This told Wang that Three Body progressed independently for each player, possibly with different worlds.",
  "",
  "“I’m a bit sick of the real world,” the young reporter said.",
  "“Three Body is already my second reality.”",
  "",
  "“Really?”",
  "Pan asked, interested.",
  "",
  "“Me too,” the software company vice president said.",
  "“Compared to Three Body, reality is so vulgar and unexciting.”",
  "",
  "“It’s too bad that it’s only a game,” said the power company executive.",
  "",
  "“Very good,” Pan said.",
  "Wang noticed his eyes sparkling with excitement.",
  "",
  "“I have a question that I think everyone wants to know the answer to,” Wang said.",
  "",
  "“I know what it is.",
  "But you might as well ask.”",
  "",
  "“Is Three Body only a game?”",
  "",
  "The other players nodded.",
  "Clearly the question was also on their minds.",
  "",
  "Pan stood up and said solemnly, “The world of Three Body, or Trisolaris, really does exist.”",
  "",
  "“Where is it?”",
  "several players asked in unison.",
  "",
  "After looking at each of them in turn, Pan sat down and spoke.",
  "“Some questions I can answer.",
  "Others I cannot.",
  "But if you are meant to be with Trisolaris, all your questions will be answered someday.”",
  "",
  "“Then … does the game really portray Trisolaris accurately?”",
  "the reporter asked.",
  "",
  "“First, the ability of Trisolarans to dehydrate through its many cycles of civilization is real.",
  "In order to adapt to the unpredictable natural environment and avoid extreme environmental conditions unsuitable for life, they can completely expel the water in their bodies and turn into dry, fibrous objects.”",
  "",
  "“What do Trisolarans look like?”",
  "",
  "Pan shook his head.",
  "“I don’t know.",
  "I really don’t.",
  "In every cycle of civilization, the appearance of Trisolarans is different.",
  "However, the game does portray something else that really existed on Trisolaris: the Trisolaran-formation computer.”",
  "",
  "“Ha!",
  "I thought that was the most unrealistic aspect,” the software company vice president said.",
  "“I conducted a test with more than a hundred employees at my company.",
  "Even if the idea worked, a computer made of people would probably operate at a speed slower than manual computation.”",
  "",
  "Pan gave a mysterious smile.",
  "“You’re right.",
  "But suppose that of the thirty million soldiers forming the computer, each one is capable of raising and lowering the black and white flags a hundred thousand times per second, and suppose also that the light cavalry soldiers on the main bus can run at several times the speed of sound, or even faster.",
  "Then the result would be very different.",
  "",
  "“You asked about the appearance of the Trisolarans just now.",
  "According to some signs, the bodies of the Trisolarans who formed the computer were covered by a purely reflective surface, which probably evolved as a response to survival under extreme conditions of sunlight.",
  "The mirrorlike surface could be deformed into any shape, and they communicated with each other by focusing light with their bodies.",
  "This kind of light-speech could transmit information extremely rapidly and was the foundation of the Trisolaran-formation computer.",
  "Of course, this was still a very inefficient machine, but it was capable of completing calculations that were too difficult to be performed manually.",
  "The computer did in fact make its first appearance in Trisolaris as formations of people, before becoming mechanical and then electronic.”",
  "",
  "Pan stood up and paced behind the players.",
  "“As a game, Three Body only borrows the background of human society to simulate the development of Trisolaris.",
  "This is done to give players a familiar environment.",
  "The real Trisolaris is very different from the world of the game, but the existence of the three suns is real.",
  "They’re the foundation of the Trisolaran environment.”",
  "",
  "“Developing this game must have cost an enormous amount of effort,” the vice president said.",
  "“But the goal is clearly not profit.”",
  "",
  "“The goal of Three Body is very simple and pure: to gather those of us who have common ideals,” Pan said.",
  "",
  "“What ideals do we have in common, exactly?”",
  "Wang immediately regretted the question.",
  "He wondered whether asking it sounded hostile.",
  "",
  "Pan studied everyone meaningfully, and then added in a soft voice, “How would you feel if Trisolaran civilization were to enter our world?”",
  "",
  "“I would be happy.”",
  "The young reporter was the first to break the silence.",
  "“I’ve lost hope in the human race after what I’ve seen in recent years.",
  "Human society is incapable of self-improvement, and we need the intervention of an outside force.”",
  "",
  "“I agree!”",
  "the author shouted.",
  "She was very excited, as though finally finding an outlet for pent-up feelings.",
  "“The human race is hideous.",
  "I’ve spent the first half of my life unveiling this ugliness with the scalpel of literature, but now I’m even sick of the work of dissection.",
  "I yearn for Trisolaran civilization to bring real beauty to this world.”",
  "",
  "Pan said nothing.",
  "That glint of excitement appeared in his eyes again.",
  "",
  "The old philosopher waved his pipe, which had gone out.",
  "He spoke with a serious mien.",
  "“Let’s discuss this question with a bit more depth: What is your impression of the Aztecs?”",
  "",
  "“Dark and bloody,” the author said.",
  "“Blood-drenched pyramids lit by insidious fires seen through dark forests.",
  "Those are my impressions.”",
  "",
  "The philosopher nodded.",
  "“Very good.",
  "Then try to imagine: If the Spanish Conquistadors did not intervene, what would have been the influence of that civilization on human history?”",
  "",
  "“You’re calling black white and white black,” the software company vice president said.",
  "“The Conquistadors who invaded the Americas were nothing more than murderers and robbers.”",
  "",
  "“Even so, at least they prevented the Aztecs from developing without bound, turning the Americas into a bloody, dark great empire.",
  "Then civilization as we know it wouldn’t have appeared in the Americas, and democracy wouldn’t have thrived until much later.",
  "Indeed, maybe they wouldn’t have appeared at all.",
  "This is the key to the question: No matter what the Trisolarans are like, their arrival will be good news for the terminally ill human race.”",
  "",
  "“But have you thought through the fact that the Aztecs were completely destroyed by the Western invaders?”",
  "the power company executive asked.",
  "He looked around, as though seeing these people for the first time.",
  "“Your thoughts are very dangerous.”",
  "",
  "“You mean profound!”",
  "the doctoral student said, raising a finger.",
  "He nodded vigorously at the philosopher.",
  "“I had the same thought, but I didn’t know how to express it.",
  "You said it so well!”",
  "",
  "After a moment of silence, Pan turned to Wang.",
  "“The other six have all given their views.",
  "What about you?”",
  "",
  "“I stand with them,” Wang said, pointing to the reporter and the philosopher.",
  "He kept his answer simple.",
  "The less said the better.",
  "",
  "“Very good,” Pan said.",
  "He turned to the software company vice president and the power company executive.",
  "“The two of you are no longer welcome at this meet-up, and you are no longer appropriate players for Three Body.",
  "Your IDs will be deleted.",
  "Please leave now.",
  "Thank you.”",
  "",
  "The two stood up and looked at each other; then glanced around, confused, and left.",
  "",
  "Pan held out his hand to the remaining five, shaking each person’s hand in turn.",
  "Then he said, solemnly, “We are comrades now.”"

  "",
  "The fifth time Wang Miao logged on to Three Body, it was dawn as usual, but the world was unrecognizable.",
  "",
  "The great pyramid that had appeared the first four times had been destroyed by the tri-solar syzygy.",
  "In its place was a tall, modern building, whose dark gray shape was familiar to Wang: the United Nations Headquarters.",
  "",
  "In the distance were many more tall buildings, apparently dehydratories.",
  "All had completely reflective mirror surfaces.",
  "In the dawn light they appeared as giant crystal plants growing out of the ground.",
  "",
  "Wang heard a violin playing something by Mozart.",
  "The playing wasn’t very practiced, but there was a special charm to it, as though saying: I play for myself.",
  "The violinist was a homeless old man sitting on the steps in front of the UN Headquarters, his fluffy silver hair fluttering in the wind.",
  "Next to his feet was an old top hat containing some scattered change.",
  "",
  "Wang suddenly noticed the sun.",
  "But it rose in the opposite direction from the dawn light, and the patch of the sky around it was still completely dark.",
  "",
  "The sun was very large, its half-risen disk taking up a third of the horizon.",
  "Wang’s heart beat faster: Such a large sun could only mean another great catastrophe.",
  "But when Wang turned around, the old man continued to play as though nothing odd was happening.",
  "His silver hair shone brilliantly in the sun, as though it was on fire.",
  "",
  "The sun was silvery, just like the old man’s hair.",
  "It cast a pale white light over the ground, but Wang couldn’t feel any warmth from the light.",
  "He gazed at the sun, which had now completely risen.",
  "On the giant silver disk he could pick out lines like wood grains: mountain ranges.",
  "",
  "Wang realized that the disk did not emit light.",
  "It only reflected the light from the real sun, which was on the other side of the sky, below the horizon.",
  "What had risen wasn’t a sun at all, but a giant moon.",
  "The giant moon moved briskly up the sky at a pace that could be detected by the naked eye.",
  "In the process, it gradually waned from a full to a half moon, and then a crescent.",
  "The old man’s soothing violin strains drifted on the cold morning breeze.",
  "The majestic sight of the universe was like the music made material.",
  "Wang was intoxicated.",
  "",
  "The giant crescent now fell into the dawn light and grew much brighter.",
  "When only two glowing tips remained above the horizon, Wang imagined them as the tips of the horns of a titanic bull rushing toward the sun.",
  "",
  "“Honored Copernicus, rest your busy feet here a while,” the old man said, after the giant moon had set.",
  "“Then after you’ve appreciated some Mozart, perhaps I can have some lunch.”",
  "",
  "“If I’m not mistaken…” Wang looked at the face full of wrinkles.",
  "The wrinkles were long and their curves gentle, as though they were trying to create a kind of harmony.",
  "",
  "“You’re not.",
  "I’m Einstein, a pitiful man full of faith in God, though abandoned by Him.”",
  "",
  "“What is that giant moon?",
  "I’ve never seen it the previous times I was here.”",
  "",
  "“It’s already cooled off.”",
  "",
  "“What?”",
  "",
  "“The big moon.",
  "When I was little it was still hot.",
  "When it rose to the middle of the sky, I could see the red glow from the central plains.",
  "But now it’s cold.",
  "… Haven’t you heard about the great rip?”",
  "",
  "“No.",
  "What’s that?”",
  "",
  "Einstein sighed and shook his head.",
  "“Let’s not speak of it.",
  "Forget the past.",
  "My past, civilization’s past, the universe’s past—all of it too painful to recall.”",
  "",
  "“How did you get to be like this?”",
  "Wang searched in his pocket and found some change.",
  "He bent over and dropped the money into the hat.",
  "",
  "“Thank you, Mr.",
  "Copernicus.",
  "Let’s hope that God doesn’t abandon you, though I don’t have much faith in that.",
  "I feel that the model you and Newton and the others created in the East with the help of the human-formation computer was very close to being correct.",
  "But the little bit of error left was like an uncrossable chasm for Newton and the others.",
  "",
  "“I’ve always believed that without me, others would have discovered special relativity eventually.",
  "But general relativity is different.",
  "The bit that Newton lacked was the effect on planetary orbit from the gravitationally induced curvature of space-time described by general relativity.",
  "Though the error caused by it was small, its impact on the results of the computation was fatal.",
  "Adding the correction factor for perturbation from space-time curvature to the classical equations would yield the right mathematical model.",
  "The amount of computational power required far exceeds what you accomplished in the East, but is easily provided by modern computers.”",
  "",
  "“Have the results of the computation been confirmed by astronomical observations?”",
  "",
  "“If that had occurred, do you think I’d be here?",
  "But from the perspective of aesthetics, I must be right and the universe must be wrong.",
  "God abandoned me, then others abandoned me as well.",
  "I’m wanted nowhere.",
  "Princeton dismissed me as a professor.",
  "UNESCO wouldn’t even have me as a science consultant.",
  "Before, even if they had begged on their knees, I wouldn’t have wanted the position.",
  "I even thought of going to Israel to be president, but they changed their minds and said I was nothing but a fraud.",
  "…”",
  "",
  "Einstein began playing again, picking up right where he had stopped.",
  "After listening to him for a while, Wang strode toward the UN building.",
  "",
  "“There’s no one in there,” Einstein said, still playing.",
  "“All the members of the General Assembly session are behind the building attending the Pendulum Initiation Ceremony.”",
  "",
  "Wang walked around the building and was greeted by a breathtaking sight: a colossal pendulum that seemed to stretch between the sky and the earth.",
  "In fact, Wang had seen it peeking out from behind the building, but he didn’t know what he was seeing.",
  "",
  "The pendulum resembled those constructed by Fu Xi to hypnotize the sun god during the Warring States Period, back when Wang Miao first logged on to Three Body.",
  "But the pendulum before him had been completely modernized.",
  "The two pillars holding up the pendulum were made of metal, each as tall as the Eiffel Tower.",
  "The weight was also made of metal, streamlined, with a smooth, mirrorlike, electroplated surface.",
  "The pendulum line, made of some ultrastrong material, was so thin as to be almost invisible, and the weight seemed to float in the air between the two towers.",
  "",
  "Below the pendulum was a crowd of people dressed in suits, probably the leaders of the various countries attending the General Assembly session.",
  "They gathered in small cliques and talked amongst themselves quietly, as though waiting for something.",
  "",
  "“Ah, Copernicus, the man who crossed five eras!”",
  "someone shouted.",
  "The others welcomed him.",
  "",
  "“You’re one of those who saw the pendulums of the Warring States Period with your own eyes!”",
  "A friendly man shook and held Wang’s hand.",
  "Someone introduced the man as the secretary general of the UN, from Africa.",
  "",
  "“Yes, I did see them,” Wang said.",
  "“But why are we building another one now?”",
  "",
  "“It’s a monument for Trisolaris, as well as a tombstone.”",
  "The secretary general looked up at the pendulum.",
  "From down here, it appeared as big as a submarine.",
  "",
  "“A tombstone?",
  "For who?”",
  "",
  "“For an aspiration, a striving that lasted through almost two hundred civilizations: the effort to solve the three-body problem, to find the pattern in the suns’ movements.”",
  "",
  "“Is the effort over?”",
  "",
  "“Yes.",
  "As of now, it’s completely over.”",
  "",
  "Wang hesitated for a moment before taking out a stack of papers, Wei Cheng’s three-body mathematical model.",
  "“I … I came here for this.",
  "I brought a mathematical model that solves the three-body problem.",
  "I have reason to believe it will likely work.”",
  "",
  "As soon as Wang said this, the crowd around him lost interest.",
  "They returned to their cliques to continue their conversations.",
  "He noticed that a few even shook their heads and laughed as they left him.",
  "The secretary general took the document and, without even glancing at it, handed it to a slender man wearing glasses standing next to him.",
  "“Out of respect for your famed reputation, I’ll have my science advisor take a look.",
  "Indeed, everyone here has shown you respect.",
  "If anyone else had said what you said, they’d be laughing at him.”",
  "",
  "The science advisor flipped through the document.",
  "“Evolutionary algorithm?",
  "Copernicus, you’re a genius.",
  "Anyone who can come up with such an algorithm is a genius.",
  "This requires not only superior math skills, but also imagination.”",
  "",
  "“You seem to be suggesting that someone has already created such a mathematical model?”",
  "",
  "“Yes.",
  "There are dozens of other mathematical models.",
  "Of those, more than half are more advanced than yours.",
  "They’ve all been implemented and run on computers.",
  "During the past two centuries, such massive computation became the principal activity of this world.",
  "Everyone waited for the results as if waiting for Judgment Day.”",
  "",
  "“And?”",
  "",
  "“We have definitively proven that the three-body problem has no solution.”",
  "",
  "Wang gazed up at the massive pendulum overhead.",
  "In the dawn light, it was crystal bright.",
  "Its deformed mirrorlike surface reflected everything around it like the eye of the world.",
  "In this place, in a distant age separated from the here and now by many civilizations, he and King Wen had passed through a forest of giant pendulums on their way to the palace of King Zhou.",
  "Just like that, history had made a long circuit and returned to its starting place.",
  "",
  "The science advisor said, “It’s just like we guessed long ago: The three-body system is a chaotic system.",
  "Tiny perturbations can be endlessly amplified.",
  "Its patterns of movement essentially cannot be mathematically predicted.”",
  "",
  "Wang felt his scientific knowledge and system of thought become a blur in a single moment.",
  "In their place was unprecedented confusion.",
  "“If even an extremely simple arrangement like the three-body system is unpredictable chaos, how can we have any faith in discovering the laws of the complicated universe?”",
  "",
  "“God is a shameless old gambler.",
  "He has abandoned us!”",
  "The speaker was Einstein, waving his violin.",
  "Wang didn’t know when he had shown up.",
  "",
  "The secretary general slowly nodded.",
  "“Yes, God is a gambler.",
  "The only hope for Trisolaran civilization is to gamble as well.”",
  "",
  "By now, the giant moon was rising again from the dark side of the horizon.",
  "Its large, silvery image was reflected by the surface of the pendulum weight.",
  "The light wriggled strangely, as though the weight and the moon had developed a mysterious sympathy together.",
  "",
  "“This civilization seems to have developed to a very advanced state,” Wang said.",
  "",
  "“Yes.",
  "We’ve mastered the energy of the atom and reached the Information Age.”",
  "The secretary general didn’t seem to be too impressed by his own words.",
  "",
  "“Then there is hope: Even if it’s impossible to know the pattern of the suns’ movements, civilization can continue to develop until it reaches a stage where it can survive the Chaotic Eras by protecting itself against the devastating catastrophes of those eras.”",
  "",
  "“People once thought as you do.",
  "That was one of the motivating forces pushing Trisolaran civilization to tenaciously come back again and again.",
  "But the moon made us realize the naïveté of such an idea.”",
  "The secretary general pointed to the rising giant moon.",
  "“This is probably the first time you’ve seen this moon.",
  "Actually, since it’s about a quarter of the size of our planet, it’s no longer a moon, but a companion to our world in a double planet system.",
  "It resulted from the great rip.”",
  "",
  "“The great rip?”",
  "",
  "“The disaster that destroyed the last civilization.",
  "Compared to the civilizations before it, they had ample warning of the disaster.",
  "Based on surviving records, the astronomers of Civilization 191 detected a frozen flying star early on.”",
  "",
  "Wang’s heart clenched as he heard the last phrase.",
  "A frozen flying star was a terrible omen for Trisolaris.",
  "When a flying star, or a distant sun, seems to come to a complete stop against the background starfield, then the sun’s and the planet’s motion vectors are aligned.",
  "This has three possible interpretations: the sun and the planet are moving in the same direction at the same speed; the sun and the planet are moving apart from each other; and the sun and the planet are moving toward each other.",
  "Before Civilization 191, this last possibility was purely theoretical, a disaster that had never occurred.",
  "But the population’s fear of it and their vigilance did not diminish, so much so that “frozen flying star” became an extremely unlucky phrase in many Trisolaran civilizations.",
  "A single flying star remaining still was sufficient to terrify everyone.",
  "",
  "“And then three flying stars froze simultaneously.",
  "The people of Civilization 191 stood on the ground, gazing up helplessly at the three frozen flying stars, at the three suns falling directly toward their world.",
  "A few days later, one of the suns moved to a distance where its outer gaseous layer became visible.",
  "In the middle of a tranquil night, the star suddenly turned into a blazing sun.",
  "Separated by intervals of thirty hours or so, the other two suns also appeared in quick succession.",
  "This was not a normal kind of tri-solar day.",
  "By the time the last flying star turned into a sun, the first sun had already swept past the planet at extremely close range.",
  "Right after that, the other two suns swept past Trisolaris at even closer ranges, well within the planet’s Roche limit (*31), such that the tidal forces imposed on Trisolaris by the three suns exceeded the force of the planet’s gravitational self-attraction.",
  "The first sun shook the deepest geological structure of the planet; the second sun tore open a great rift in the planet that went straight to the core; and the third sun ripped the planet into two pieces.”",
  "",
  "*31- Author’s Note: Roche limit: Édouard Roche, French astronomer, was the first to calculate the theoretical distance between two celestial bodies such that the smaller body will be torn apart by tidal forces from the larger body.",
  "The Roche limit is usually expressed as a function of the densities of the bodies and the equatorial radius of the larger body.",
  "",
  "The secretary general pointed at the giant moon overhead.",
  "“That’s the smaller piece.",
  "There are still ruins from Civilization 191 on it, but it’s a lifeless world.",
  "It was the most terrible disaster in the entire history of Trisolaris.",
  "After the planet was torn apart, the two irregularly shaped pieces each returned to spherical form under self-gravitation.",
  "The dense, searing planetary core material gushed to the surface, and the oceans boiled over the lava.",
  "The continents drifted over the magma like icebergs.",
  "As they collided, the ground became as soft as the ocean.",
  "Massive mountain ranges tens of thousands of meters high rose in an hour and disappeared just as quickly.",
  "",
  "“For a while, the two ripped-apart pieces were still connected by streams of molten lava that coalesced into a space-spanning river.",
  "Then the lava cooled and turned into rings around the planets, but because of perturbations from the planets, the rings were unstable.",
  "The rocks that formed them fell back to the surface in a rain of giant stones that lasted several centuries.",
  "… Can you imagine what kind of hell that was?",
  "The ecological destruction caused by this catastrophe was the most severe in all of history.",
  "All life on the companion planet went extinct, and the mother planet almost became a lifeless waste as well.",
  "But in the end, the seeds of life managed to germinate here, and as the geology of the mother planet settled down, evolution began its tottering steps in new oceans and on new continents, until civilization reappeared for the one hundred and ninety-second time.",
  "The entire process took ninety million years.",
  "",
  "“Trisolaris’s place in the universe is even more grim than we had imagined.",
  "What will happen the next time frozen flying stars occur?",
  "Very likely, our planet will not just skim past the edge of the sun, but will plunge into the fiery sea of the sun itself.",
  "Given enough time, this possibility will become certainty.",
  "",
  "“This was originally just a frightening speculation, but a recent astronomical discovery has caused us to lose all hope for the fate of Trisolaris.",
  "The researchers had intended to recover the history of the formation of the stars and the planets based on signs in this stellar system.",
  "Instead, they discovered that, in the distant past, the Trisolaran stellar system had twelve planets.",
  "Yet, now only this one remains.",
  "",
  "“There is only one explanation: The other eleven planets have all been consumed by the three suns!",
  "Our world is nothing more than the sole survivor of a Great Hunt.",
  "The fact that civilization has been reincarnated a hundred and ninety-two times is only a kind of luck.",
  "Also, after further study, we discovered the phenomenon of ‘breathing’ by the three stars.”",
  "",
  "“The stars breathe?”",
  "",
  "“It’s only a metaphor.",
  "You discovered the gaseous outer layer of the suns, but you didn’t know that this gaseous layer expands and contracts over cycles lasting eons, like breathing.",
  "When the gaseous layer expands, its thickness can grow by more than a dozen times.",
  "This greatly increases the diameter of the sun, like a giant mitt that can catch planets more easily.",
  "When a planet passes by a sun at close range, it will enter the sun’s gaseous layer.",
  "Friction will cause it to lose speed, and finally, like a meteor, it will fall into the blazing sea of the sun, dragging a long, fiery tail.",
  "",
  "“The study results show that in the long history of the Trisolaran stellar system, every time the suns’ gaseous layers expanded, one or two planets were consumed.",
  "The other eleven planets all fell into a fiery sea during times when the gaseous layers were at their greatest.",
  "Right now, the gaseous layers of the three suns are in a contracted stage—otherwise our planet would have already fallen into one of them the last time they skimmed past.",
  "But scholars predict that the next expansion will occur in one thousand years.”",
  "",
  "“We can’t stay in this terrible place anymore,” Einstein said, crouched down on the ground like an old beggar.",
  "",
  "The secretary general nodded.",
  "“We can’t stay here any longer.",
  "The only path left for Trisolaran civilization is to gamble with the universe.”",
  "",
  "“How?”",
  "Wang asked.",
  "",
  "“We must leave the Trisolaran stellar system and fly into the wide open sea of stars.",
  "We must find in the galaxy a new world to emigrate to.”",
  "",
  "Wang heard a grinding noise.",
  "He saw that the giant weight of the pendulum was being pulled up by a thin cable whose other end was attached to an elevated winch.",
  "As it rose to its highest point, a great waning crescent moon descended slowly in the sky behind it.",
  "",
  "The secretary general solemnly announced, “Start the pendulum.”",
  "",
  "The elevated winch released the cable tied to the pendulum, and the weight noiselessly fell along a smooth arc.",
  "Initially, it fell slowly, but then it accelerated, reaching maximum speed at the bottom of the arc.",
  "As it sliced through the air, the sound of the wind was deep and resonant.",
  "By the time the noise disappeared, the pendulum had followed the arc to its highest point on the other side, and, after pausing for a moment, began its backward swing.",
  "",
  "Wang felt the great force generated by the movement of the pendulum, as though the ground was shaken by its swings.",
  "Unlike a pendulum in the real world, this giant pendulum’s period was not stable, but changed constantly.",
  "This was due to the continually shifting gravitational attraction of the giant moon.",
  "When the giant moon was on this side of the planet, its gravity partially canceled out the gravity of the planet, causing the pendulum to lose weight.",
  "When it was on the other side of the planet, its gravity was added to the gravity of the planet, causing the pendulum’s weight to increase, almost to the level it would have had before the great rip.",
  "",
  "As he gazed up at the awe-inspiring swings of the Trisolaran Pendulum Monument, Wang asked himself, Does it represent the yearning for order, or the surrender to chaos?",
  "Wang also thought of the pendulum as a gigantic metal fist, swinging eternally against the unfeeling universe, noiselessly shouting out Trisolaran civilization’s indomitable battle cry.",
  "…",
  "",
  "As Wang Miao’s eyes blurred with tears, he saw a line of text appear against the background of the swinging pendulum:",
  "",
  "Four hundred and fifty-one years later, Civilization 192 was destroyed by the fiery flames of twin suns appearing together.",
  "It had reached the Atomic Age and the Information Age.",
  "",
  "Civilization 192 was a milestone in Trisolaran civilization.",
  "It finally proved that the three-body problem had no solution.",
  "It gave up the useless effort that had already lasted through 191 cycles and set the course for future civilizations.",
  "Thus, the goal of Three Body has changed.",
  "",
  "The new goal is: Head for the stars; find a new home.",
  "",
  "We invite you to log on again.",
  "",
  "*   *   *",
  "",
  "After logging out of Three Body, Wang felt exhausted, the same way he did after each previous session.",
  "But this time, he only rested half an hour before logging in again.",
  "",
  "This time, against the pitch-black background, an unexpected line of text appeared:",
  "",
  "The situation is urgent.",
  "The Three Body servers are about to be shut down.",
  "Please log on freely during the remaining time.",
  "Three Body will now go directly to the final scene."

  "Wang merasakan kekuatan besar yang dihasilkan oleh gerakan bandul itu, seolah-olah tanah terguncang oleh ayunannya.",
  "Tidak seperti bandul di dunia nyata, periode bandul raksasa ini tidak stabil, melainkan berubah terus-menerus.",

  "Since she entered Red Coast Base, Ye Wenjie had never thought of leaving.",
  "After she learned the real purpose of the Red Coast Project, top-secret information that even many mid-level cadres at the base didn’t know, she cut off her spiritual connection to the outside world and devoted herself to her work.",
  "Thereafter, she became even more deeply embedded in the technical core of Red Coast, and began to take on more important research topics.",
  "",
  "Commissar Lei never forgot that it was Chief Yang who first trusted Ye, but Lei was happy to assign important topics to her.",
  "Given Ye’s status, she had no rights to the results of her research.",
  "And Lei, who had studied astrophysics, was a political officer who was also an intellectual, rare at the time.",
  "Thus he could take credit for all of Ye’s research results and papers, and cast himself as an exemplary political officer with both technical acumen and revolutionary zeal.",
  "",
  "The Red Coast Project had initially requisitioned Ye because of a paper on an attempted mathematical model of the sun she had published in the Journal of Astrophysics as a graduate student.",
  "Compared to the Earth, the sun was a far simpler physical system, made almost entirely of hydrogen and helium.",
  "Though its physical processes were violent, they were relatively straightforward, only fusing hydrogen into helium.",
  "Thus, it was likely that a mathematical model of the sun could describe it rather precisely.",
  "The paper was basic, but Lei and Yang saw in it a hope for a solution to a technical difficulty faced by the Red Coast monitoring system.",
  "",
  "Solar outages, a common problem in satellite communications, had always plagued the Red Coast monitoring operations.",
  "",
  "When the Earth, an artificial satellite, and the sun are in a straight line, the line of sight from the ground-based antenna to the satellite will have the sun as its background.",
  "The sun is a giant source of electromagnetic radiation, and, as a result, satellite transmissions to the ground will be overwhelmed by interference from the solar radiation.",
  "This problem could not be completely solved, even in the twenty-first century.",
  "",
  "The interference that Red Coast had to deal with was similar, but the source of interference (the sun) was between the source of the transmission (outer space) and the ground-based receiver.",
  "Compared to communication satellites, the solar outages suffered by Red Coast were more frequent and more severe.",
  "Red Coast Base as constructed was also much more modest than its original design, such that the transmission and monitoring systems shared the same antenna.",
  "This made the times available for monitoring even more precious, and solar outages even more of a problem.",
  "",
  "Lei and Yang’s idea for eliminating interference was very simple: ascertain the frequency spectrum and characteristics of solar radiation in the monitored range, and then filter it out digitally.",
  "Both of them were technical, and at that time, when the ignorant often led the knowledgeable, that was a rare bit of fortune.",
  "But Yang wasn’t a specialist in astrophysics, and Lei had taken the path of becoming a political officer, which prevented him from accruing in-depth technical know-how.",
  "In reality, electromagnetic radiation from the sun is only stable within the limited range from near-ultraviolet to mid-infrared (including visible light).",
  "In other ranges, the radiation is quite volatile and unpredictable.",
  "",
  "To set the right expectations, Ye made it clear in her first research report that during periods of intense solar activity—sunspots, solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and so on—it was impossible to eliminate solar interference.",
  "Thus, her research target was limited to radiation within the frequency ranges monitored by Red Coast during periods of normal solar activity.",
  "",
  "Research conditions at the base weren’t too bad.",
  "The library could obtain foreign-language materials related to the topic, including timely European and American academic journals.",
  "In those years, this was no easy feat.",
  "Ye also could use the military phone line to connect to the two groups conducting solar science research within the Chinese Academy of Sciences and obtain their observation data by fax.",
  "",
  "After half a year of study, Ye saw no glimpse of hope.",
  "She quickly discovered that within the frequency ranges monitored by Red Coast, solar radiation fluctuated unpredictably.",
  "By analyzing large amounts of observed data, Ye discovered a puzzling mystery.",
  "Sometimes, during one of the sudden fluctuations in solar radiation, the surface of the sun was calm.",
  "Since hundreds of thousands of kilometers of solar material would absorb any shortwave and microwave radiation originating from the core of the sun, the radiation must have come from activities on its surface, so there should have been observable surface activity when these fluctuations occurred.",
  "If there were no corresponding surface disturbances, what caused these sudden changes to the narrow frequency ranges?",
  "The more she thought about it, the more mysterious it seemed.",
  "",
  "Eventually Ye ran out of ideas and decided to give up.",
  "In her last report, she conceded that she could not solve the problem.",
  "This shouldn’t have been a big deal.",
  "The military had asked several groups within universities and the Chinese Academy of Sciences to research the same issue, and all of those efforts had failed.",
  "But Yang wanted to try one more time, relying on Ye’s extraordinary talent.",
  "",
  "Lei’s agenda was even simpler: He just wanted Ye’s paper.",
  "The research topic was highly theoretical and would show off his expertise and skill.",
  "Now that the chaos in society was finally subsiding, the demands on cadres were also changing.",
  "There was an acute need for men like him, politically mature and academically accomplished.",
  "Of course he would have a bright future.",
  "As to whether the problem of interference from solar outages could be solved, he didn’t really care.",
  "",
  "But in the end, Ye didn’t hand in her report.",
  "She thought that if the research project were terminated, the base library would stop receiving foreign language journals and other research materials, and she would no longer have access to such a rich trove of astrophysics references.",
  "So she nominally continued her research, while in reality she focused on refining her mathematical model of the sun.",
  "",
  "One night, Ye was, as usual, the only person in the cold reading room of the base library.",
  "On the long table in front of her, a pile of documents and journals were spread open.",
  "After completing a set of tedious and cumbersome matrix calculations, she blew on her hands to warm them, and picked up the latest issue of the Journal of Astrophysics to take a break.",
  "As she flipped through it, a brief note about Jupiter caught her attention:",
  "",
  "Last issue, in “A New, Powerful Radiation Source Within the Solar System,” Dr.",
  "Harry Peterson of Mount Wilson Observatory published a set of data accidentally obtained while observing Jupiter’s precession on June 12 and July 2, during which strong electromagnetic radiation was detected, lasting 81 seconds and 76 seconds, respectively.",
  "The data included the frequency ranges of the radiation as well as other parameters.",
  "During the radio outbursts, Peterson also observed certain changes in the Great Red Spot.",
  "This discovery drew a lot of interest from planetary scientists.",
  "In this issue, G.",
  "McKenzie’s article argues that it was a sign of fusion starting within Jupiter’s core.",
  "In the next issue we will publish Inoue Kumoseki’s article, which attributes the Jovian radio outbursts to a more complicated mechanism—the movements of internal metallic hydrogen plates—and gives a complete mathematical description.",
  "",
  "Ye clearly remembered the two dates noted in the paper.",
  "During those windows, the Red Coast monitoring system had also received strong interference from solar outages.",
  "She checked the operations diary and confirmed her memory.",
  "The times were close, but the solar outages had occurred sixteen minutes and forty-two seconds after the arrival of the Jovian radio outbursts on Earth.",
  "",
  "The sixteen minutes and forty-two seconds are critical!",
  "Ye tried to calm her wild heartbeat, and asked the librarian to contact the National Observatory to obtain the ephemeris of the Earth’s and Jupiter’s positions during those two time periods.",
  "",
  "She drew a big triangle on the blackboard with the sun, the Earth, and Jupiter at the vertices.",
  "She marked the distances along the three edges, and wrote down the two arrival times next to the Earth.",
  "From the distance between the Earth and Jupiter it was easy to figure out the time it took for the radio outbursts to travel between the two.",
  "Then she calculated the time it would take the radio outbursts to go from Jupiter to the sun, and then from the sun to the Earth.",
  "The difference between the two was exactly sixteen minutes and forty-two seconds.",
  "",
  "Ye referred to her solar structure mathematical model and tried to find a theoretical explanation.",
  "Her eyes were drawn to her description of what she called “energy mirrors” within the solar radiation zone.",
  "",
  "Energy produced by reaction within the solar core is initially in the form of high-energy gamma rays.",
  "The radiation zone, the region of the sun’s interior that surrounds the core, absorbs these high-energy photons and re-emits them at a slightly lower energy level.",
  "After a long period of successive absorption and re-emission (a photon might take a thousand years to leave the sun), gamma rays become x-rays, extreme ultraviolet, ultraviolet, then eventually turn into visible light and other forms of radiation.",
  "",
  "Such were the known facts about the sun.",
  "But Ye’s model led to a new result: As solar radiation dropped through these different frequencies on its way through the radiation zone, there were boundaries between the subzones for each type of radiation.",
  "As energy crossed each boundary, the radiation frequency stepped down a grade sharply.",
  "This was different from the traditional view that the radiation frequency lowered gradually as energy passed from the core outwards.",
  "Her calculations showed that these boundaries would reflect radiation coming from the lower-frequency side, which was why she named the boundaries “energy mirrors.”",
  "",
  "Ye had carefully studied these membranelike boundary surfaces suspended in the high-energy plasma ocean of the sun and discovered them to be full of wonderful properties.",
  "One of the most incredible characteristics she named “gain reflectivity.”",
  "However, the characteristic was so bizarre that it was hard to confirm, and even Ye herself didn’t quite believe it was real.",
  "It seemed more likely an artifact of some error in the dizzying, complex calculations.",
  "",
  "But now, Ye made the first step in confirming her guess about the gain reflectivity of solar energy mirrors: The energy mirrors not only reflected radiation coming from the lower-frequency side, but amplified it.",
  "All the mysterious sudden fluctuations within narrow frequency bands that she had observed were in fact the result of other radiation coming from space being amplified after reflecting off an energy mirror in the sun.",
  "That was why there were no observable disturbances on the surface of the sun.",
  "",
  "This time, after the Jovian radio outbursts reached the sun, they were re-emitted, as if by a mirror, after being amplified about a hundred million times.",
  "The Earth received both sets of emissions, before and after the amplification, separated by sixteen minutes and forty-two seconds.",
  "",
  "The sun was an amplifier for radio waves.",
  "",
  "However, there was a question: The sun must be receiving electromagnetic radiation from space every second, including radio waves emitted by the Earth.",
  "Why were only some of the waves amplified?",
  "The answer was simple: In addition to the selectivity of the energy mirrors for frequencies they would reflect, the main reason was the shielding effect of the solar convection zone.",
  "The endlessly boiling convection zone situated outside the radiation zone was the outermost liquid layer of the sun.",
  "The radio waves coming from space must first penetrate the convection zone to reach the energy mirrors in the radiation zone, where they would be amplified and reflected back out.",
  "This meant that in order to reach the energy mirrors, the waves would have to be more powerful than a threshold value.",
  "The vast majority of Earth-based radio sources could not cross this threshold, but the Jovian radio outburst did—",
  "",
  "And Red Coast’s maximum transmission power also exceeded the threshold.",
  "",
  "The problem with solar outages was not resolved, but another exciting possibility presented itself: Humans could use the sun as a superantenna, and, through it, broadcast radio waves to the universe.",
  "The radio waves would be sent with the power of the sun, hundreds of millions of times greater than the total usable transmission power on Earth.",
  "",
  "Earth civilization had a way to transmit at the level of a Kardashev Type II civilization.",
  "",
  "The next step was to compare the waveforms of the two Jovian radio outbursts with the waveforms of the solar outages received by Red Coast.",
  "If they matched, then her guess would receive further confirmation.",
  "",
  "Ye made her request to the base leadership to contact Harry Peterson and obtain the waveform records of the two Jovian radio outbursts.",
  "This was not easy.",
  "It was difficult to find the right communication channels, and numerous bureaucracies required layers of formal paperwork.",
  "Any error could lead to her being suspected of acting as a foreign spy.",
  "So Ye had to wait.",
  "",
  "But there was a more direct way to prove the hypothesis: Red Coast itself could transmit radio waves directly at the sun at a power level exceeding the threshold value.",
  "",
  "Ye again made her request to the base leadership.",
  "But she didn’t dare to give her real reason—it was too fantastic, and she would have been turned down for certain.",
  "Instead, she explained that she wanted to do an experiment for her solar research: The Red Coast transmission system would be used as a solar exploration radar whose echoes could be analyzed to obtain some information about solar radiation.",
  "Lei and Yang both had deep technical backgrounds, and wouldn’t have been easily fooled, but the experiment described by Ye did have real precedents in Western solar research.",
  "In fact, her suggestion was technically easier than the radar exploration of terrestrial planets already being conducted.",
  "",
  "“Ye Wenjie, you’re getting out of line,” said Commissar Lei.",
  "“Your research should be focused on theory.",
  "Do we really need to go to so much trouble?”",
  "",
  "Ye begged, “Commissar, it’s possible that a big discovery will be made.",
  "Experiments are absolutely necessary.",
  "I just want to try it once, please?”",
  "",
  "Chief Yang said, “Commissar Lei, maybe we should try once.",
  "It doesn’t seem to be too difficult operationally.",
  "Receiving the echoes after transmission would take—”",
  "",
  "“Ten, fifteen minutes,” Lei said.",
  "",
  "“Then Red Coast has just enough time to switch from transmission mode to monitoring mode.”",
  "",
  "Lei shook his head again.",
  "“I know that it’s technically and operationally feasible.",
  "But you … eh, Chief Yang, you just lack the sensitivity for this kind of thing.",
  "You want to aim a superpowerful radio beam at the red sun.",
  "Have you thought about the political symbolism of such an experiment (*32)?”",
  "",
  "*32- Translator’s Note: Chairman Mao was often compared to the “red sun,” especially during the years of the Cultural Revolution.",
  "",
  "Yang and Ye were both utterly stunned, but they did not think Lei’s objection ridiculous.",
  "Just the opposite: They were horrified that they themselves had not thought of it.",
  "During those years, finding political symbolism in everything had reached absurd levels.",
  "The research reports Ye turned in had to be carefully reviewed by Lei so that even technical terms related to the sun could be repeatedly revised to remove political risk.",
  "Terms like “sunspots” were forbidden (*33).",
  "An experiment that sent a powerful radio transmission at the sun could of course be interpreted in a thousand positive ways, but a single negative interpretation would be enough to bring political disaster on everyone.",
  "Lei’s reason for refusing to allow the experiment was truly unassailable.",
  "*",
  "",
  "*33- Translator’s Note: The Chinese term for “sunspot” () literally means “solar black spots.”",
  "Black, of course, was the color of counter-revolutionaries.",
  "",
  "Ye didn’t give up, though.",
  "In fact, as long as she didn’t take excessive risk, it wasn’t difficult to accomplish her goal.",
  "The Red Coast transmitter was ultra-high-powered, but all of its components were domestically produced during the Cultural Revolution.",
  "As the quality of the components was not up to par, the fault rate was very high.",
  "After every fifteenth transmission, the entire system had to be overhauled, and after each overhaul, there would be a test transmission.",
  "Few people attended these tests, and the targets and other parameters were arbitrarily selected.",
  "",
  "One time when she was on duty, Ye was assigned to work during one of the test transmissions after an overhaul.",
  "Because a test transmission omitted many operational steps, only Ye and five others were present.",
  "Three of them were low-level operators who knew little about the principles behind the equipment.",
  "The remaining two were a technician and an engineer, both exhausted and not paying much attention after two days of overhaul work.",
  "Ye first adjusted the test transmission power to exceed the threshold value for her gain-reflective solar energy mirror theory, using the maximum power of the Red Coast transmission system.",
  "Then she set the frequency to the value most likely to be amplified by the energy mirror.",
  "And under the guise of testing the antenna’s mechanical components, she aimed it at the setting sun in the west.",
  "The content of the transmission remained the same as usual.",
  "",
  "This was a clear afternoon in the autumn of 1971.",
  "Afterwards, Ye recalled the event many times but couldn’t remember any special feelings except anxiety, a desire for the transmission to be completed quickly.",
  "First, she was afraid to be discovered by her colleagues.",
  "Even though she had thought of some excuses, it was still unusual to use maximum power for a test transmission, because doing so would wear down the components.",
  "In addition, the Red Coast transmission system’s positioning equipment was never designed to be aimed at the sun.",
  "Ye could feel the eyepiece growing hot.",
  "If it burnt out she would be in real trouble.",
  "",
  "As the sun set slowly in the west, Ye had to manually track it.",
  "The Red Coast antenna seemed like a giant sunflower at that moment, slowly turning to follow the descending sun.",
  "By the time the red light indicating transmission completion lit up, she was already soaked in sweat.",
  "",
  "She glanced around.",
  "The three operators at the control panel were shutting down the equipment piece by piece in accordance with the instructions in the operating manual.",
  "The engineer was drinking a glass of water in a corner of the control room, and the technician was asleep in his chair.",
  "No matter how historians and writers later tried to portray the scene, the reality at the time was completely prosaic.",
  "",
  "The transmission completed, Ye rushed out of the control room and dashed into Yang Weining’s office.",
  "Catching her breath, she said, “Tell the base station to begin monitoring the twelve thousand megahertz channel!”",
  "",
  "“What are we receiving?”",
  "Chief Yang looked in surprise at Ye, strands of hair stuck to her sweaty face.",
  "Compared to the highly sensitive Red Coast monitoring system, the conventional military-grade radio—normally used by the base for communicating with the outside—was only a toy.",
  "",
  "“Maybe we’ll get something.",
  "There’s no time to change the Red Coast systems to monitoring mode!”",
  "Normally, warming up and switching over to the monitoring system required a little more than ten minutes.",
  "But right now the monitoring system was also being overhauled.",
  "Many modules had been taken apart and remained unassembled, rendering them inoperable in the short term.",
  "",
  "Yang stared at Ye for a few seconds, and then picked up the phone and ordered the communications office to follow Ye’s direction.",
  "",
  "“Given the low sensitivity of that radio, we can probably only receive signals from extraterrestrials on the moon.”",
  "",
  "“The signal comes from the sun,” Ye said.",
  "Outside the window, the sun’s edge was already approaching the mountains on the horizon, red as blood.",
  "",
  "“You used Red Coast to send a signal to the sun?”",
  "Yang asked anxiously.",
  "",
  "Ye nodded.",
  "",
  "“Don’t tell anyone else.",
  "This must never happen again.",
  "Never!”",
  "Yang looked behind him to be sure there was no one at the door.",
  "",
  "Ye nodded again.",
  "",
  "“What’s the point?",
  "The echo wave must be extremely weak, far outside the sensitivity of a conventional radio.”",
  "",
  "“No.",
  "If my guess is right, we should get an extremely strong echo.",
  "It will be more powerful than … I can hardly imagine.",
  "As long as the transmission power exceeds a certain threshold, the sun can amplify the signal a hundred million–fold.”",
  "",
  "Yang looked at Ye strangely.",
  "Ye said nothing.",
  "They both waited in silence.",
  "Yang could clearly hear Ye’s breath and heartbeat.",
  "He hadn’t paid much attention to what she had said, but the feelings he had buried in his heart for many years resurfaced.",
  "He could only restrain himself, waiting.",
  "",
  "Twenty minutes later, Yang picked up the phone, called the communications office, and asked a few simple questions.",
  "",
  "He put the phone down.",
  "“They received nothing.”",
  "",
  "Ye let out a long-held breath and eventually nodded.",
  "",
  "“That American astronomer responded, though.”",
  "Yang took out a thick envelope covered with customs stamps and handed it to Ye.",
  "She tore the envelope open and scanned Harry Peterson’s letter.",
  "The letter said that he had not imagined that there would be colleagues in China studying planetary electromagnetism, and that he wished to collaborate and exchange more information in the future.",
  "He had also sent two stacks of paper: the complete record of the waveforms of the radio outbursts from Jupiter.",
  "They were clearly photocopied from the long signal recording tape, and would have to be pieced together.",
  "",
  "Ye took the dozens of sheets of photocopier paper and started lining them up in two columns on the floor.",
  "Halfway through the effort she gave up any hope.",
  "She was very familiar with the waveforms of the interference from the two solar outages.",
  "They didn’t match these two.",
  "",
  "Ye slowly picked up the photocopies from the floor.",
  "Yang crouched down to help her.",
  "When he handed the stack of paper to this woman he loved with all his heart, he saw her smile.",
  "The smile was so sad that his heart trembled.",
  "",
  "“What’s wrong?”",
  "he asked, not realizing that he had never spoken to her so softly.",
  "",
  "“Nothing.",
  "I’m just waking up from a dream.”",
  "Ye smiled again.",
  "She took the stack of photocopies and the envelope and left the office.",
  "She went back to her room, picked up her lunch box, and went to the cafeteria.",
  "Only mantou buns and pickles were left, and the cafeteria workers told her impatiently that they were closing.",
  "So she had no choice but to carry her lunch box outside and walk next to the lip of the cliff, where she sat down on the grass to chew the cold mantou.",
  "",
  "The sun had already set.",
  "The Greater Khingan Mountains were gray and indistinct, just like Ye’s life.",
  "In this gray life, a dream appeared especially colorful and bright.",
  "But one always awoke from a dream, just like the sun—which, though it would rise again, brought no fresh hope.",
  "In that moment Ye saw the rest of her life suffused with an endless grayness.",
  "With tears in her eyes, she smiled again, and continued to chew the cold mantou.",
  "",
  "Ye didn’t know that at that moment, the first cry that could be heard in space from civilization on Earth was already spreading out from the sun to the universe at the speed of light.",
  "A star-powered radio wave, like a majestic tide, had already crossed the orbit of Jupiter.",

  "Sejak menjejakkan kaki di Pangkalan Red Coast, tak pernah terlintas di benak Ye Wenjie untuk pergi.",
  "Setelah mengetahui tujuan sebenarnya dari Proyek Red Coast—informasi maharahasia yang bahkan tidak diketahui banyak kader tingkat menengah di pangkalan itu—ia memutus ikatan batinnya dengan dunia luar dan mencurahkan seluruh hidupnya untuk bekerja.",
  "Sejak saat itu, ia semakin terlibat jauh dalam inti teknis Red Coast, dan mulai menangani topik-topik penelitian yang lebih krusial.",
  "",
  "Komisaris Lei tidak pernah lupa bahwa Kepala Yang-lah yang pertama kali memercayai Ye, namun Lei dengan senang hati melimpahkan tugas-tugas penting kepadanya.",
  "Mengingat status politiknya, Ye tidak memiliki hak apa pun atas hasil penelitiannya.",
  "Dan Lei, yang pernah mempelajari astrofisika, adalah seorang perwira politik sekaligus kaum intelektual—kombinasi yang langka pada masa itu.",
  "Dengan demikian, ia bisa mengklaim seluruh hasil penelitian dan makalah Ye, lalu mencitrakan dirinya sebagai perwira politik teladan yang memiliki kecerdasan teknis sekaligus semangat revolusioner.",
  "",
  "Proyek Red Coast awalnya merekrut Ye karena sebuah makalah tentang percobaan model matematika matahari yang pernah ia terbitkan di Journal of Astrophysics semasa menjadi mahasiswa pascasarjana.",
  "Dibandingkan Bumi, matahari adalah sistem fisik yang jauh lebih sederhana, tersusun hampir seluruhnya dari hidrogen dan helium.",
  "Meski proses fisiknya berlangsung dahsyat, mekanismenya relatif sederhana, hanya berupa fusi hidrogen menjadi helium.",
  "Karena itu, besar kemungkinan sebuah model matematika matahari dapat mendeskripsikannya dengan cukup presisi.",
  "Makalah itu memang mendasar, namun Lei dan Yang melihat secercah harapan di dalamnya untuk mengatasi kesulitan teknis yang dihadapi sistem pemantauan Red Coast.",

  "Ketika Bumi, satelit buatan, dan matahari berada dalam satu garis lurus, garis pandang dari antena di darat ke satelit akan memiliki matahari sebagai latar belakangnya.",
  "Matahari adalah sumber raksasa radiasi elektromagnetik, dan akibatnya, transmisi satelit ke stasiun bumi akan tertutup oleh interferensi dari radiasi matahari.",
  "Masalah ini tidak dapat diatasi sepenuhnya, bahkan hingga abad kedua puluh satu.",

  "Interferensi yang harus dihadapi Red Coast serupa, namun sumber interferensinya (matahari) berada di antara sumber transmisi (luar angkasa) dan penerima di darat.",
  "Dibandingkan dengan satelit komunikasi, gangguan matahari yang dialami Red Coast jauh lebih sering dan lebih parah.",
  "Pangkalan Red Coast yang dibangun juga jauh lebih sederhana daripada rancangan aslinya, sehingga sistem transmisi dan pemantauan harus berbagi antena yang sama.",
  "Hal ini membuat waktu yang tersedia untuk pemantauan menjadi semakin berharga, dan gangguan matahari menjadi masalah yang kian pelik.",

  "Gagasan Lei dan Yang untuk menghilangkan interferensi sangat sederhana: pastikan spektrum frekuensi dan karakteristik radiasi matahari dalam rentang yang dipantau, lalu saring secara digital.",
  "Keduanya berlatar belakang teknis, dan pada masa itu, ketika orang bodoh sering kali memimpin orang pintar, hal tersebut merupakan keberuntungan yang langka.",
  "Namun Yang bukan spesialis astrofisika, dan Lei telah menempuh jalan sebagai perwira politik, yang menghalanginya memperdalam pengetahuan teknis.",

  "Di rentang lain, radiasi tersebut sangat fluktuatif dan tak terduga.",

  "Dengan menganalisis sejumlah besar data pengamatan, Ye menemukan sebuah misteri yang membingungkan.",
  "Terkadang, saat terjadi fluktuasi mendadak pada radiasi matahari, permukaan matahari justru tenang.",
  "Karena materi surya setebal ratusan ribu kilometer akan menyerap radiasi gelombang pendek dan gelombang mikro apa pun yang berasal dari inti matahari, radiasi tersebut pastilah berasal dari aktivitas di permukaannya, sehingga seharusnya ada aktivitas permukaan yang dapat diamati saat fluktuasi ini terjadi.",

  "Harry Peterson dari Observatorium Mount Wilson memublikasikan sekumpulan data yang diperoleh secara tidak sengaja saat mengamati presesi Jupiter pada 12 Juni dan 2 Juli, di mana radiasi elektromagnetik kuat terdeteksi, masing-masing berlangsung selama 81 detik dan 76 detik.",
  "Data tersebut mencakup rentang frekuensi radiasi serta parameter lainnya.",
  "Selama ledakan radio tersebut, Peterson juga mengamati perubahan tertentu pada Bintik Merah Raksasa.",
  "Penemuan ini menarik banyak minat dari para ilmuwan planet.",
  "Dalam edisi ini, G.",
  "Artikel McKenzie berpendapat bahwa itu adalah tanda dimulainya fusi di dalam inti Jupiter.",
  "Pada edisi berikutnya kami akan memuat artikel Inoue Kumoseki, yang mengaitkan ledakan radio Jupiter dengan mekanisme yang lebih rumit—pergerakan lempeng hidrogen logam internal—dan memberikan deskripsi matematis yang lengkap.",
  "",
  "Ye ingat betul dua tanggal yang tercatat dalam makalah itu.",
  "Selama jendela waktu tersebut, sistem pemantauan Red Coast juga menerima interferensi kuat dari gangguan matahari.",
  "Ia memeriksa buku harian operasi dan memastikan ingatannya.",
  "Waktunya berdekatan, tetapi gangguan matahari terjadi enam belas menit empat puluh dua detik setelah kedatangan ledakan radio Jupiter di Bumi.",
  "",
  "Enam belas menit empat puluh dua detik itu sangat krusial!",
  "Ye mencoba menenangkan detak jantungnya yang liar, dan meminta pustakawan menghubungi Observatorium Nasional untuk mendapatkan efemeris posisi Bumi dan Jupiter selama dua periode waktu tersebut.",
  "",
  "Ia menggambar segitiga besar di papan tulis dengan matahari, Bumi, dan Jupiter di titik-titik sudutnya.",
  "Ia menandai jarak di sepanjang ketiga sisinya, dan menuliskan dua waktu kedatangan di sebelah Bumi.",
  "Dari jarak antara Bumi dan Jupiter, mudah untuk mengetahui waktu yang dibutuhkan ledakan radio untuk merambat di antara keduanya.",
  "Kemudian ia menghitung waktu yang dibutuhkan ledakan radio untuk bergerak dari Jupiter ke matahari, lalu dari matahari ke Bumi.",
  "Selisih antara keduanya tepat enam belas menit empat puluh dua detik.",
  "",
  "Ye merujuk pada model matematika struktur mataharinya dan mencoba mencari penjelasan teoretis.",
  "Matanya tertuju pada deskripsinya tentang apa yang ia sebut “cermin energi” di dalam zona radiasi matahari.",
  "",
  "Energi yang dihasilkan oleh reaksi di dalam inti matahari awalnya berupa sinar gamma berenergi tinggi.",
  "Zona radiasi, wilayah interior matahari yang mengelilingi inti, menyerap foton berenergi tinggi ini dan memancarkannya kembali pada tingkat energi yang sedikit lebih rendah.",
  "Setelah periode panjang penyerapan dan pemancaran kembali yang berturut-turut (sebuah foton mungkin butuh seribu tahun untuk meninggalkan matahari), sinar gamma menjadi sinar-X, ultraungu ekstrem, ultraungu, lalu akhirnya berubah menjadi cahaya tampak dan bentuk radiasi lainnya.",
  "",
  "Itulah fakta-fakta yang diketahui tentang matahari.",
  "Namun model Ye mengarah pada hasil baru: Saat radiasi matahari turun melalui frekuensi-frekuensi berbeda ini dalam perjalanannya melewati zona radiasi, terdapat batas-batas di antara subzona untuk setiap jenis radiasi.",
  "Saat energi melintasi setiap batas, frekuensi radiasi turun tingkat secara tajam.",
  "Ini berbeda dari pandangan tradisional bahwa frekuensi radiasi menurun secara bertahap saat energi bergerak dari inti ke luar.",
  "Perhitungannya menunjukkan bahwa batas-batas ini akan memantulkan radiasi yang datang dari sisi frekuensi yang lebih rendah, itulah sebabnya ia menamai batas-batas tersebut “cermin energi.”",
  "",
  "Ye telah mempelajari dengan cermat permukaan batas serupa selaput yang tergantung di lautan plasma berenergi tinggi matahari ini dan menemukan bahwa mereka penuh dengan sifat-sifat menakjubkan.",
  "Salah satu karakteristik paling luar biasa ia namai “reflektivitas penguatan”.",
  "Namun, karakteristik itu begitu aneh sehingga sulit dikonfirmasi, dan bahkan Ye sendiri tidak begitu yakin itu nyata.",
  "Tampaknya itu lebih mungkin merupakan artefak dari suatu kesalahan dalam perhitungan rumit yang memusingkan.",
  "",
  "Namun kini, Ye mengambil langkah pertama dalam mengonfirmasi dugaannya tentang reflektivitas penguatan cermin energi surya: Cermin energi tidak hanya memantulkan radiasi yang datang dari sisi frekuensi rendah, tetapi juga memperkuatnya.",
  "Semua fluktuasi mendadak yang misterius dalam pita frekuensi sempit yang ia amati sebenarnya adalah hasil dari radiasi lain dari luar angkasa yang diperkuat setelah memantul dari cermin energi di matahari.",
  "Itulah sebabnya tidak ada gangguan yang dapat diamati di permukaan matahari.",
  "",
  "Kali ini, setelah ledakan radio Jupiter mencapai matahari, gelombang itu dipancarkan kembali, seolah oleh cermin, setelah diperkuat sekitar seratus juta kali.",
  "Bumi menerima kedua set emisi tersebut, sebelum dan sesudah penguatan, terpisah selama enam belas menit empat puluh dua detik.",
  "",
  "Matahari adalah penguat gelombang radio.",
  "",
  "Namun, ada satu pertanyaan: Matahari pasti menerima radiasi elektromagnetik dari luar angkasa setiap detik, termasuk gelombang radio yang dipancarkan oleh Bumi.",
  "Mengapa hanya sebagian gelombang yang diperkuat?",
  "Jawabannya sederhana: Selain selektivitas cermin energi terhadap frekuensi yang akan mereka pantulkan, alasan utamanya adalah efek perisai dari zona konveksi matahari.",
  "Zona konveksi yang mendidih tanpa henti di luar zona radiasi adalah lapisan cair terluar matahari.",
  "Gelombang radio yang datang dari luar angkasa harus menembus zona konveksi terlebih dahulu untuk mencapai cermin energi di zona radiasi, tempat mereka akan diperkuat dan dipantulkan kembali keluar.",
  "Ini berarti agar dapat mencapai cermin energi, gelombang tersebut harus lebih kuat dari nilai ambang batas tertentu.",
  "Sebagian besar sumber radio di Bumi tidak dapat melewati ambang batas ini, tetapi ledakan radio Jupiter bisa—",
  "",
  "Dan daya transmisi maksimum Red Coast juga melampaui ambang batas itu.",
  "",
  "Masalah gangguan matahari belum teratasi, namun kemungkinan lain yang menggairahkan muncul: Manusia bisa menggunakan matahari sebagai antena super, dan melaluinya, menyiarkan gelombang radio ke alam semesta.",
  "Gelombang radio akan dikirim dengan kekuatan matahari, ratusan juta kali lebih besar daripada total daya transmisi yang dapat digunakan di Bumi.",
  "",
  "Peradaban Bumi memiliki cara untuk melakukan transmisi setingkat peradaban Kardashev Tipe II.",
  "",
  "Langkah selanjutnya adalah membandingkan bentuk gelombang dari dua ledakan radio Jupiter dengan bentuk gelombang gangguan matahari yang diterima oleh Red Coast.",
  "Jika cocok, maka dugaannya akan mendapat konfirmasi lebih lanjut.",
  "",
  "Ye mengajukan permintaan kepada pimpinan pangkalan untuk menghubungi Harry Peterson dan mendapatkan rekaman bentuk gelombang dari dua ledakan radio Jupiter tersebut.",
  "Ini bukan hal yang mudah.",
  "Sulit untuk menemukan saluran komunikasi yang tepat, dan berbagai birokrasi menuntut lapisan dokumen resmi.",
  "Kesalahan sedikit saja bisa menyebabkannya dicurigai bertindak sebagai mata-mata asing.",
  "Jadi Ye harus menunggu.",
  "",
  "Namun ada cara yang lebih langsung untuk membuktikan hipotesis tersebut: Red Coast sendiri bisa memancarkan gelombang radio langsung ke matahari pada tingkat daya yang melebihi nilai ambang batas.",
  "",
  "Ye kembali mengajukan permintaannya kepada pimpinan pangkalan.",
  "Namun ia tidak berani memberikan alasan sebenarnya—itu terlalu fantastis, dan ia pasti akan ditolak.",
  "Sebaliknya, ia menjelaskan bahwa ia ingin melakukan eksperimen untuk penelitian mataharinya: Sistem transmisi Red Coast akan digunakan sebagai radar eksplorasi surya yang gemanya dapat dianalisis untuk mendapatkan informasi tentang radiasi matahari.",
  "Lei dan Yang sama-sama memiliki latar belakang teknis yang mendalam, dan tidak akan mudah dibodohi, tetapi eksperimen yang digambarkan oleh Ye memang memiliki preseden nyata dalam penelitian surya Barat.",
  "Faktanya, sarannya secara teknis lebih mudah daripada eksplorasi radar planet-planet terestrial yang sudah dilakukan.",
  "",
  "“Ye Wenjie, kau sudah melampaui batas,” kata Komisaris Lei.",
  "“Penelitianmu seharusnya fokus pada teori.",
  "Apa kita benar-benar perlu bersusah payah begitu?”",
  "",
  "Ye memohon, “Komisaris, mungkin saja penemuan besar akan dibuat.",
  "Eksperimen mutlak diperlukan.",
  "Saya hanya ingin mencobanya sekali, tolong?”",
  "",
  "Kepala Yang berkata, “Komisaris Lei, mungkin kita harus mencoba sekali.",
  "Secara operasional tampaknya tidak terlalu sulit.",
  "Menerima gema setelah transmisi akan memakan waktu—”",
  "",
  "“Sepuluh, lima belas menit,” kata Lei.",
  "",
  "“Kalau begitu Red Coast punya cukup waktu untuk beralih dari mode transmisi ke mode pemantauan.”",
  "",
  "Lei menggeleng lagi.",
  "“Aku tahu itu layak secara teknis dan operasional.",
  "Tapi kau... eh, Kepala Yang, kau kurang peka untuk hal semacam ini.",
  "Kau ingin mengarahkan sinar radio superkuat ke matahari merah.",
  "Pernahkah kau memikirkan simbolisme politik dari eksperimen semacam itu (*32)?”",
  "",
  "*32- Catatan Penerjemah: Ketua Mao sering dibandingkan dengan “matahari merah”, terutama selama tahun-tahun Revolusi Kebudayaan.",
  "",
  "Yang dan Ye sama-sama terperangah, tetapi mereka tidak menganggap keberatan Lei konyol.",
  "Justru sebaliknya: Mereka ngeri karena mereka sendiri tidak memikirkan hal itu.",
  "Selama tahun-tahun itu, mencari simbolisme politik dalam segala hal telah mencapai tingkat yang tidak masuk akal.",
  "Laporan penelitian yang diserahkan Ye harus ditinjau dengan cermat oleh Lei sehingga istilah teknis yang berkaitan dengan matahari pun harus direvisi berulang kali untuk menghilangkan risiko politik.",
  "Istilah seperti “bintik matahari” dilarang (*33).",
  "Eksperimen yang mengirimkan transmisi radio kuat ke matahari tentu saja bisa ditafsirkan dalam seribu cara positif, tetapi satu penafsiran negatif saja sudah cukup untuk membawa bencana politik bagi semua orang.",
  "Alasan Lei menolak mengizinkan eksperimen itu benar-benar tak terbantahkan.",
  "*",
  "",
  "*33- Catatan Penerjemah: Istilah bahasa Mandarin untuk “bintik matahari” () secara harfiah berarti “bintik hitam surya.”",
  "Hitam, tentu saja, adalah warna kaum kontrarevolusioner.",

  "Namun, Ye tidak menyerah.",
  "Faktanya, selama ia tidak mengambil risiko berlebihan, tidak sulit untuk mencapai tujuannya.",
  "Pemancar Red Coast berdaya sangat tinggi, tetapi semua komponennya diproduksi di dalam negeri selama Revolusi Kebudayaan.",
  "Karena kualitas komponennya tidak memenuhi standar, tingkat kerusakannya sangat tinggi.",
  "Setelah setiap transmisi kelima belas, seluruh sistem harus diperbaiki besar-besaran, dan setelah setiap perbaikan, akan ada transmisi uji coba.",
  "Sedikit orang yang menghadiri tes ini, dan target serta parameter lainnya dipilih secara sembarang.",
  "",
  "Suatu kali saat sedang bertugas, Ye ditugaskan untuk bekerja selama salah satu transmisi uji coba setelah perbaikan.",
  "Karena transmisi uji coba menghilangkan banyak langkah operasional, hanya Ye dan lima orang lainnya yang hadir.",
  "Tiga di antaranya adalah operator tingkat rendah yang hanya tahu sedikit tentang prinsip di balik peralatan tersebut.",
  "Dua sisanya adalah seorang teknisi dan seorang insinyur, keduanya kelelahan dan tidak terlalu memperhatikan setelah dua hari kerja perbaikan.",
  "Ye pertama-tama menyesuaikan daya transmisi uji coba agar melebihi nilai ambang batas untuk teori cermin energi surya reflektif-penguatannya, menggunakan daya maksimum sistem transmisi Red Coast.",
  "Kemudian ia mengatur frekuensi ke nilai yang paling mungkin diperkuat oleh cermin energi.",
  "Dan dengan dalih menguji komponen mekanis antena, ia mengarahkannya ke matahari terbenam di barat.",
  "Isi transmisi tetap sama seperti biasanya.",
  "",
  "Itu adalah sore yang cerah di musim gugur tahun 1971.",
  "Di kemudian hari, Ye mengingat kembali peristiwa itu berkali-kali tetapi tidak bisa mengingat perasaan khusus apa pun kecuali kecemasan, keinginan agar transmisi segera selesai.",
  "Pertama, ia takut ketahuan oleh rekan-rekannya.",
  "Meskipun ia sudah memikirkan beberapa alasan, tetap saja tidak lazim menggunakan daya maksimum untuk transmisi uji coba, karena hal itu akan membuat komponen cepat aus.",
  "Selain itu, peralatan pemosisian sistem transmisi Red Coast tidak pernah dirancang untuk diarahkan ke matahari.",
  "Ye bisa merasakan lensa bidiknya memanas.",
  "Jika terbakar, ia akan benar-benar dalam masalah.",
  "",
  "Saat matahari perlahan terbenam di barat, Ye harus melacaknya secara manual.",
  "Antena Red Coast tampak seperti bunga matahari raksasa pada saat itu, perlahan berputar mengikuti matahari yang turun.",
  "Pada saat lampu merah yang menandakan selesainya transmisi menyala, ia sudah basah kuyup oleh keringat.",
  "",
  "Ia melihat sekeliling.",
  "Ketiga operator di panel kendali sedang mematikan peralatan satu per satu sesuai dengan instruksi dalam buku panduan operasi.",
  "Insinyur itu sedang minum segelas air di sudut ruang kendali, dan teknisi itu tertidur di kursinya.",
  "Tidak peduli bagaimana sejarawan dan penulis kelak mencoba menggambarkan adegan itu, kenyataan pada saat itu benar-benar biasa saja.",
  "",
  "Transmisi selesai, Ye bergegas keluar dari ruang kendali dan berlari ke kantor Yang Weining.",
  "Sambil mengatur napas, ia berkata, “Suruh stasiun pangkalan mulai memantau saluran dua belas ribu megahertz!”",
  "",
  "“Apa yang kita terima?”",
  "Kepala Yang menatap Ye dengan terkejut, helai-helai rambut menempel di wajahnya yang berkeringat.",
  "Dibandingkan dengan sistem pemantauan Red Coast yang sangat sensitif, radio militer konvensional—yang biasanya digunakan pangkalan untuk berkomunikasi dengan dunia luar—hanyalah mainan.",
  "",
  "“Mungkin kita akan mendapatkan sesuatu.",
  "Tidak ada waktu untuk mengubah sistem Red Coast ke mode pemantauan!”",
  "Biasanya, pemanasan dan peralihan ke sistem pemantauan memerlukan waktu sedikit lebih dari sepuluh menit.",
  "Namun saat ini sistem pemantauan juga sedang diperbaiki.",
  "Banyak modul telah dibongkar dan belum dipasang kembali, membuatnya tidak dapat dioperasikan dalam waktu singkat.",
  "",
  "Yang menatap Ye selama beberapa detik, lalu mengangkat telepon dan memerintahkan kantor komunikasi untuk mengikuti arahan Ye.",
  "",
  "“Mengingat rendahnya sensitivitas radio itu, kita mungkin hanya bisa menerima sinyal dari makhluk luar angkasa di bulan.”",
  "",
  "“Sinyalnya berasal dari matahari,” kata Ye.",
  "Di luar jendela, tepi matahari sudah mendekati pegunungan di cakrawala, merah seperti darah.",

  "“Apa gunanya?",
  "Gelombang gemanya pasti sangat lemah, jauh di luar sensitivitas radio konvensional.”",
  "",
  "“Tidak.",
  "Jika dugaanku benar, kita seharusnya mendapatkan gema yang sangat kuat.",

  "Yang menatap Ye dengan aneh.",
  "Ye tidak berkata apa-apa.",
  "Keduanya menunggu dalam diam.",
  "Yang bisa mendengar dengan jelas napas dan detak jantung Ye.",
  "Ia tidak terlalu memperhatikan apa yang dikatakan Ye, tetapi perasaan yang telah ia kubur dalam hatinya selama bertahun-tahun muncul kembali.",
  "Ia hanya bisa menahan diri, menunggu.",

  "Dua puluh menit kemudian, Yang mengangkat telepon, menghubungi kantor komunikasi, dan mengajukan beberapa pertanyaan sederhana.",

  "The next eight years were among the most peaceful of Ye Wenjie’s life.",
  "The horror experienced during the Cultural Revolution gradually subsided, and she was finally able to relax a little.",
  "The Red Coast Project completed its testing and breaking-in phases, settling down into routine operation.",
  "Fewer and fewer technical problems remained, and both work and life became regular.",
  "",
  "In peace, what had been suppressed by anxiety and fear began to reawaken.",
  "Ye found that the real pain had just begun.",
  "Nightmarish memories, like embers coming back to life, burned more and more fiercely, searing her heart.",
  "For most people, perhaps time would have gradually healed these wounds.",
  "After all, during the Cultural Revolution, many people suffered fates similar to hers, and compared to many of them, Ye was relatively fortunate.",
  "But Ye had the mental habits of a scientist, and she refused to forget.",
  "Rather, she looked with a rational gaze on the madness and hatred that had harmed her.",
  "",
  "Ye’s rational consideration of humanity’s evil side began the day she read Silent Spring.",
  "As she grew closer to Yang Weining, he was able to get her many classics of foreign-language philosophy and history under the guise of gathering technical research materials.",
  "The bloody history of humanity shocked her, and the extraordinary insights of the philosophers also led her to understand the most fundamental and secret aspects of human nature.",
  "",
  "Indeed, even on top of Radar Peak, a place the world almost forgot, the madness and irrationality of the human race were constantly on display.",
  "Ye saw that the forest below the peak continued to fall to the deranged logging by her former comrades.",
  "Patches of bare earth grew daily, as though those parts of the Greater Khingan Mountains had had their skin torn off.",
  "When those patches grew into regions and then into a connected whole, the few surviving trees seemed rather abnormal.",
  "To complete the slash-and-burn plan, fires were lit on the bare fields, and Radar Peak became the refuge for birds escaping the fiery inferno.",
  "As the fires raged, the sorrowful cries of birds with singed feathers at the base never ceased.",
  "",
  "The insanity of the human race had reached its historical zenith.",
  "The Cold War was at its height.",
  "Nuclear missiles capable of destroying the Earth ten times over could be launched at a moment’s notice, spread out among the countless missile silos dotting two continents and hidden within ghostlike nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines patrolling deep under the sea.",
  "A single Lafayette- or Yankee-class submarine held enough warheads to destroy hundreds of cities and kill hundreds of millions, but most people continued their lives as if nothing was wrong.",
  "",
  "As an astrophysicist, Ye was strongly against nuclear weapons.",
  "She knew this was a power that should belong only to the stars.",
  "She knew also that the universe had even more terrible forces: black holes, antimatter, and more.",
  "Compared to those forces, a thermonuclear bomb was nothing but a tiny candle.",
  "If humans obtained mastery over one of those other forces, the world might be vaporized in a moment.",
  "In the face of madness, rationality was powerless.",

  "Four years after entering Red Coast Base, Ye and Yang married.",
  "Yang truly loved her.",
  "For love, he gave up his future.",
  "",
  "The fiercest stage of the Cultural Revolution was over, and the political climate had grown somewhat milder.",
  "Yang wasn’t persecuted, exactly, for his marriage.",
  "However, because he married a woman who had been deemed to be a counter-revolutionary, he was viewed as politically immature and lost his position as chief engineer.",
  "The only reason that he and his wife were allowed to stay on the base as ordinary technicians was because the base could not do without their technical skills.",
  "",
  "Ye accepted Yang’s proposal mainly out of gratitude.",
  "If he hadn’t brought her into this safe haven in her most perilous moment, she would probably no longer be alive.",
  "Yang was a talented man, cultured and with good taste.",
  "She didn’t find him unpleasant, but her heart was like ashes from which the flame of love could no longer be lit.",
  "",
  "As she pondered human nature, Ye was faced with an ultimate loss of purpose and sank into another spiritual crisis.",
  "She had once been an idealist who needed to give all her talent to a great goal, but now she realized that all that she had done was meaningless, and the future could not have any meaningful pursuits, either.",
  "As this mental state persisted, she gradually felt more and more alienated from the world.",
  "She didn’t belong.",
  "The sense of wandering in the spiritual wilderness tormented her.",
  "After she made a home with Yang, her soul became homeless.",
  "",
  "One night, Ye was working the night shift.",
  "This was the loneliest time.",
  "In the deep silence of midnight, the universe revealed itself to its listeners as a vast desolation.",
  "What Ye disliked most was seeing the waves that slowly crawled across the display, a visual record of the meaningless noise Red Coast picked up from space.",
  "Ye felt this interminable wave was an abstract view of the universe: one end connected to the endless past, the other to the endless future, and in the middle only the ups and downs of random chance—without life, without pattern, the peaks and valleys at different heights like uneven grains of sand, the whole curve like a one-dimensional desert made of all the grains of sand lined up in a row, lonely, desolate, so long that it was intolerable.",
  "You could follow it and go forward or backward as long as you liked, but you’d never find the end.",
  "",
  "On this day, however, Ye saw something odd when she glanced at the waveform display.",
  "Even experts had a hard time telling with the naked eye whether a waveform carried information.",
  "But Ye was so familiar with the noise of the universe that she could tell that the wave that now moved in front of her eyes had something extra.",
  "The thin curve, rising and falling, seemed to possess a soul.",
  "She was certain that the radio signal before her had been modulated by intelligence.",
  "",
  "She rushed to another terminal and checked the computer’s rating of the signal’s recognizability: AAAAA.",
  "Before this, no radio signal received by Red Coast ever garnered a recognizability rating above C.",
  "An A rating meant the likelihood that the transmission contained intelligent information was greater than 90 percent.",
  "A rating of AAAAA was a special, extreme case: It meant the received transmission used the exact same coding language as Red Coast’s own outbound transmission.",
  "",
  "Ye turned on the Red Coast deciphering system.",
  "The software attempted to decipher any signal whose recognizability rating was above B.",
  "During the entire time that the Red Coast Project had been running, it had never been invoked even once in real use.",
  "Based on test data, deciphering a transmission suspected of being a message might require a few days or even a few months of computing time, and the result would be failure more than half the time.",
  "But this time, as soon as the file containing the original transmission was submitted, the display showed that the deciphering was complete.",

  "As she read the flashing green text on the display, Ye was no longer capable of thinking clearly.",
  "Her mind, inhibited by shock and excitement, could only understand this: No more than nine years had passed since the time she had sent the message to the sun.",
  "Then the source of this transmission must be around four light-years away.",
  "It could only have come from the closest extra-solar stellar system: Alpha Centauri (*34).",

  "The universe was not empty.",
  "The universe was full of life!",
  "Humankind had cast their gaze to the end of the universe, but they had no idea that intelligent life already existed around the stars closest to them!",
  "",
  "Ye stared at the waveform display: The signal continued to stream from the universe into the Red Coast antenna.",
  "She opened up another interface and began real-time deciphering.",
  "The messages began to show up immediately on the screen.",
  "",
  "During the next four hours, Ye learned of the existence of Trisolaris, learned of the civilization that had been reborn again and again, and learned of their plan to migrate to the stars.",
  "",
  "At four in the morning, the transmission from Alpha Centauri ended.",
  "The deciphering system continued to run uselessly and emitted an unceasing string of failure codes.",
  "The Red Coast monitoring system was once again only hearing the noise of the universe.",
  "",
  "But Ye was certain that what she had just experienced was not a dream.",
  "",
  "The sun really was an amplifying antenna.",
  "But why had her experiment eight years ago not received any echoes?",
  "Why had the waveforms of Jupiter’s radio outbursts not matched the later radiation from the sun?",
  "Later, Ye came up with many reasons.",
  "It was possible that the base communication office couldn’t receive radio waves at that frequency, or maybe the office did receive the echo but it sounded like noise and so the operator thought it was nothing.",
  "As for the waveforms, it was possible that when the sun amplified the radio waves, it also added another wave to it.",
  "It would likely be a periodic wave that could be easily filtered out by the alien deciphering system, but to her unaided eye, the waveform from Jupiter and from the sun would appear very different.",
  "Years later, after Ye had left Red Coast, she would manage to confirm her last guess: The sun had added a sine wave.",
  "",
  "She looked around alertly.",
  "There were three others in the main computer room.",
  "Two of the three were chatting in a corner, while the last was napping before a terminal.",
  "In the data analysis section of the monitoring system, only the two terminals in front of her could view the recognizability rating of a signal and access the deciphering system.",
  "",
  "Maintaining her composure, she worked quickly and moved all of the received messages to a multiply-encrypted, invisible subdirectory.",
  "Then she copied over a segment of noise received a year ago as a substitute for the transmission received during the last five hours.",
  "",
  "Finally, from the terminal, she placed a short message into the Red Coast transmission buffer.",
  "",
  "Ye got up and left the monitoring main control room.",
  "A chilly wind blew against her feverish face.",
  "Dawn had just brightened the eastern sky, and she followed the dimly lit pebble-paved path to the transmission main control room.",
  "Above her, the Red Coast antenna lay open, silently, like a giant palm toward the universe.",
  "The dawn turned the guard at the door into a silhouette, and as usual, he did not pay attention to Ye as she entered.",
  "",
  "The transmission main control room was much dimmer than the monitoring main control room.",
  "Ye passed through rows of cabinets to stand in front of the control panel and flipped more than a dozen switches with practiced ease to warm up the transmission system.",
  "The two men on duty next to the control panel looked up at her with sleepy eyes, and one turned to glance at the clock.",
  "Then one of them went back to his nap while the other flipped through a well-thumbed newspaper.",
  "At the base, Ye had no political status, but she did have some freedom in technical matters.",
  "She often tested the equipment before a transmission.",
  "Although she was early today—the transmission wasn’t scheduled to occur until three hours later—warming up a bit early wasn’t that unusual.",
  "",
  "What happened next was the longest half hour of her life.",

  "Mungkin saja kantor komunikasi pangkalan tidak bisa menerima gelombang radio pada frekuensi itu, atau mungkin kantor itu menerima gemanya tetapi terdengar seperti kebisingan sehingga operator mengira itu bukan apa-apa.",

  "“Ya.",
  "Jika material nano superkuat bisa diproduksi massal, itu akan meletakkan dasar teknis untuk membangun lift luar angkasa dari tanah hingga ke titik geostasioner di angkasa.",
  "Bagi Tuan kami, ini hanyalah penemuan kecil; tapi bagi manusia di Bumi, maknanya akan sangat signifikan.",
  "Dengan teknologi ini, manusia dapat dengan mudah memasuki ruang dekat Bumi dan membangun struktur pertahanan berskala besar.",

  "Satu tim tentara yang memegang senapan mesin ringan menyerbu masuk.",
  "Wang menyadari mereka bukan polisi bersenjata, melainkan tentara sungguhan.",
  "Tanpa suara mereka bergerak menyusuri dinding dan segera mengepung para pemberontak ETO.",

  "Mereka berlari menuju patung tiga-benda, dan masing-masing menyambar satu bola serta mendekapnya di depan dada.",
  "",
  "Wanita muda itu mengangkat bola logam berkilau di depannya dengan kedua tangan, seolah sedang bersiap memulai gerakan senam.",
  "Sambil tersenyum, dia berkata, “Pak Petugas, di tangan kami ada tiga bom nuklir, masing-masing berkekuatan sekitar satu koma lima kiloton.",
  "Tidak terlalu besar, karena kami suka mainan kecil.",
  "Ini pemicunya.”",
  "",
  "Semua orang di kafetaria membeku.",
  "Satu-satunya yang bergerak adalah Shi Qiang.",
  "Dia memasukkan kembali pistolnya ke sarung di bawah ketiak kiri dan menangkupkan kedua tangannya dengan tenang.",

  "Indikatornya turun sekitar setengah jalan lalu berhenti.",
  "",
  "Wanita muda itu terkekeh.",
  "Si ahli bahan peledak juga tertawa, dengan nada meremehkan.",

  "Pejuang ETO lain mengambil timbangan serta tas itu dan mengulangi prosedurnya dengan bolanya sendiri, lalu berakhir dengan melempar bola itu ke tanah juga.",
  "",
  "Wanita muda itu tertawa sekali lagi dan mengambil sendiri tas tersebut.",
  "Dia memasukkan bolanya ke dalam tas, menggantungnya pada kait timbangan, dan indikatornya langsung anjlok ke dasar; pegas dalam timbangan itu terentang maksimal.",

  "Senyum di wajah ahli bahan peledak itu membeku.",
  "Dia berbisik pada Da Shi, “Sialan!",
  "Mereka benar-benar punya satu.”",
  "",
  "Da Shi tetap tak bergeming.",
  "",
  "Ahli bahan peledak itu berkata, “Setidaknya kita bisa pastikan ada elemen berat—bahan fisil—di dalamnya.",
  "Kita tidak tahu apakah mekanisme pemicunya berfungsi.”",
  "",
  "Senter yang terpasang pada senapan para tentara terfokus pada wanita muda yang memegang bom nuklir itu.",
  "Sementara dia menggenggam daya hancur setara 1,5 kiloton TNT di tangannya, dia tersenyum cerah, seolah menikmati tepuk tangan dan pujian di panggung yang disorot lampu.",
  "",
  "“Aku punya ide: Tembak bolanya,” bisik ahli bahan peledak itu kepada Da Shi.",
  "",
  "“Bukankah itu akan memicu bomnya?”",
  "",
  "“Bahan peledak konvensional di bagian luarnya akan meledak, tapi ledakannya akan menyebar.",

  "",

  "INTERROGATOR: I know the basics.",
  "If something is unclear I’ll ask you.",
  "",
  "YE: Good.",
  "On the day when I received the extraterrestrial communication and replied, I learned that I wasn’t the only one to get the message.",
  "Lei did as well.",
  "",
  "*   *   *",
  "",
  "Lei was a typical political cadre of the time, so he possessed an extremely keen sense for politics and saw everything through an ideological lens.",
  "Unbeknownst to most of the technical staff at Red Coast Base, he ran a small program in the background on the main computer.",
  "This program constantly read from the transmission and reception buffers and stored the results in a hidden encrypted file.",
  "This way, there would be a copy of everything Red Coast sent and received that only he could read.",
  "It was from this copy that he discovered the extraterrestrial message.",
  "",
  "On the afternoon after I sent my message toward the rising sun, and shortly after I learned that I was pregnant at the base clinic, Lei called me to his office, and I saw that his terminal displayed the message from Trisolaris that I had received the night before.",
  "…",
  "",
  "*   *   *",
  "",
  "“Eight hours have passed since you received the first message.",
  "Instead of making a report, you deleted the original message and maybe hid a copy.",
  "Isn’t that right?”",
  "",
  "I kept my head down and did not reply.",
  "",
  "“I know your next move.",
  "You plan to reply.",
  "If I hadn’t discovered this in time, you could have ruined all human civilization!",
  "Of course I’m not saying that we’re afraid of an interstellar invasion.",
  "Even if we assumed the worst and that really did happen, the outer space invaders would surely drown in the ocean of the people’s righteous war!”",
  "",
  "I realized then that he didn’t know that I’d already replied.",
  "When I placed the answer into the transmission buffer, I didn’t use the regular file interface.",
  "Luckily, this got around his monitoring program.",
  "",
  "“Ye Wenjie, I knew you were capable of something like this.",
  "You’ve always held a deep hatred toward the Party and the people.",
  "You would seize any opportunity for revenge.",
  "Do you know the consequences of your actions?”",
  "",
  "Of course I knew, so I nodded.",
  "Lei was silent for a moment.",
  "But what he said next was unexpected.",
  "“Ye Wenjie, I have no pity for you at all.",
  "You’ve always been a class enemy who views the people as your adversaries.",
  "But I’ve served many years with Yang.",
  "I cannot bear to see him ruined along with you, and I certainly cannot allow his child to be ruined as well.",
  "You’re pregnant, aren’t you?”",
  "",
  "What he said wasn’t idle speculation.",
  "During that era, my deeds would certainly have implicated my husband if revealed, regardless of whether he had anything to do with them.",
  "",
  "Lei kept his voice very low.",
  "“Right now, only you and I know what happened.",
  "What we must do is to minimize the impact of your actions.",
  "Pretend that it never happened and never mention it to anyone, including Yang.",
  "I’ll take care of the rest.",
  "As long as you cooperate, you can avoid the disastrous consequences.”",
  "",
  "I immediately knew what Lei was after.",
  "He wanted to become the first man to discover extraterrestrial intelligence.",
  "It really was a great opportunity to get his name into the history textbooks.",
  "",
  "I assented.",
  "Then I left his office.",
  "I’d already decided everything.",
  "",
  "I took a small wrench and went to the equipment closet for the processing module of the receiver.",
  "Because I often needed to inspect the equipment, no one paid attention.",
  "I opened the main cabinet and carefully loosened the bolt that secured the ground wire to the bottom.",
  "The interference on the receiver suddenly increased and the ground resistance went up from 0.6 ohms to 5 ohms.",
  "The technician on duty thought it was a problem with the ground wire, because that kind of malfunction happened a lot.",
  "It was an easy diagnosis.",
  "He would never have guessed that the problem was at this end, at the top of the ground wire, because this end was securely fastened, out of the way, and I told him that I had just inspected it.",
  "",
  "The top of Radar Peak had an unusual geological feature: a layer of clay more than a dozen meters thick—poor conductivity—covered it.",
  "When the ground wire wasn’t buried deeply, ground resistance was invariably too high.",
  "However, the ground wire couldn’t be sunk too deep, either, because the clay layer had a strong corrosive effect, and after a while, it would corrode the middle section of the ground wire.",
  "In the end, the only solution was to drape the ground wire over the lip of the cliff until the tip was below the clay layer, and then bury the ground terminal into the cliff at that point.",
  "Even so, the grounding wasn’t very stable, and the resistance was often excessive.",
  "Whenever such problems occurred, the trouble always involved the part of the wire going into the cliff.",
  "Whoever was assigned to repair it would have to go over the edge of the cliff, dangling on ropes.",
  "",
  "The technician on duty informed the maintenance squad of the issue.",
  "One of the soldiers in the squad tied a rope to an iron post and then rappelled down the cliff.",
  "After half an hour down below, he climbed back up, soaked in sweat, saying that he couldn’t find the malfunction.",
  "It seemed that the next monitoring session would have to be delayed.",
  "There was no choice but to inform the Base Command Center.",
  "I waited by the iron post at the top of the cliff.",
  "Very soon, just as I had planned, Lei Zhicheng came back with that soldier.",
  "",
  "To be honest, Lei was very dedicated to his job and faithfully followed the demands placed on political officers during that era: Become a part of the masses and always be on the front line.",
  "Maybe it was all for show, but he really was a good performer.",
  "Whenever there was some difficult and perilous work at the base, he was sure to volunteer.",
  "One of the tasks that he performed more than anyone else was to repair the ground wire, a task both dangerous and tiring.",
  "Even though this job wasn’t particularly demanding technically, it did benefit from experience.",
  "There were many causes of malfunction: a loose contact due to exposure to open air—difficult to detect—or possibly the location where the ground wire went into the cliff was too dry.",
  "The volunteer soldiers responsible for external maintenance were all new, and none had much experience.",
  "So I had guessed that Lei would most likely show up.",
  "",
  "He put on the safety harness and went over the cliff edge on the rope, as though I didn’t exist.",
  "I made some excuse to get rid of the soldier who brought him so that I was the only one left on the cliff.",
  "Then I took a short hacksaw out of my pocket.",
  "It was made from a longer saw blade broken into three pieces and then stacked together.",
  "With the stacked blades, any cut I made would be particularly ragged, and it would not be obvious later that the rope was cut through with a tool.",
  "",
  "Just then, my husband, Yang Weining, showed up.",
  "",
  "After I explained to him what had happened, he looked over the cliff edge.",
  "Then he said that to inspect the ground terminal in the cliff face required digging, and the work would be too much for just Lei.",
  "He wanted to go down to help, so he put on the safety harness left by that other soldier.",
  "I asked him to use another rope, but he said no—the rope that Lei was on was thick and sturdy and could easily bear the weight of two.",
  "I insisted, so he told me to go get the rope.",
  "By the time I rushed back to the cliff with the rope, he had already gone down over the side.",
  "I poked my head over the edge and saw that he and Lei had already finished their inspection and were climbing back up.",
  "Lei was in the front.",
  "",
  "There would never be another chance.",
  "I took out my hacksaw and cut through the rope.",
  "",
  "*   *   *",
  "",
  "INTERROGATOR: I want to ask a question, but I won’t record the answer.",
  "How did you feel at the time?",
  "",
  "YE: Calm.",
  "I did it without feeling anything.",
  "I had finally found a goal to which I could devote myself.",
  "I didn’t care what price had to be paid, either by me or by others.",
  "I also knew that the entire human race would pay an unprecedented price for this goal.",
  "This was a very insignificant beginning.",
  "",
  "INTERROGATOR: All right.",
  "Continue.",
  "",
  "YE: I heard two or three surprised cries, and then the sound of bodies slamming against the rocks at the cliff bottom.",
  "After a while, I saw that the stream at the foot of the cliff had turned red.",

  "Aku mengambil kunci pas kecil dan pergi ke lemari peralatan untuk modul pemrosesan penerima.",
  "Karena aku sering perlu memeriksa peralatan, tidak ada yang memperhatikan.",
  "Aku membuka kabinet utama dan dengan hati-hati melonggarkan baut yang mengamankan kabel arde ke bagian bawah.",
  "Interferensi pada penerima tiba-tiba meningkat dan resistansi arde naik dari 0,6 ohm menjadi 5 ohm.",
  "Teknisi yang bertugas mengira itu masalah pada kabel arde, karena kerusakan semacam itu sering terjadi.",
  "Itu diagnosis yang mudah.",
  "Dia tidak akan pernah menduga bahwa masalahnya ada di ujung sini, di bagian atas kabel arde, karena ujung ini terpasang kuat, tersembunyi, dan aku memberitahunya bahwa aku baru saja memeriksanya.",
  "",
  "Puncak Radar memiliki fitur geologis yang tidak biasa: lapisan tanah liat setebal belasan meter—yang konduktivitasnya buruk—menutupinya.",
  "Jika kabel arde tidak ditanam dalam-dalam, resistansi tanahnya pasti terlalu tinggi.",
  "Namun, kabel arde juga tidak bisa ditanam terlalu dalam, karena lapisan tanah liat itu memiliki efek korosif yang kuat, dan setelah beberapa waktu, akan mengorosi bagian tengah kabel arde.",
  "Akhirnya, satu-satunya solusi adalah menjuntaikan kabel arde melewati bibir tebing sampai ujungnya berada di bawah lapisan tanah liat, lalu menanam terminal arde ke dinding tebing di titik itu.",
  "Meski begitu, pembumiannya tidak terlalu stabil, dan resistansinya sering kali berlebihan.",
  "Setiap kali masalah seperti itu terjadi, gangguan selalu melibatkan bagian kabel yang masuk ke tebing.",
  "Siapa pun yang ditugaskan memperbaikinya harus turun melewati tepi tebing, bergelantungan pada tali.",
  "",
  "Teknisi yang bertugas memberi tahu regu pemeliharaan tentang masalah tersebut.",
  "Salah satu tentara di regu itu mengikatkan tali ke tiang besi lalu turun menuruni tebing.",

  "Sepertinya sesi pemantauan berikutnya harus ditunda.",
  "Tidak ada pilihan selain memberi tahu Pusat Komando Pangkalan.",
  "Aku menunggu di dekat tiang besi di puncak tebing.",

  "",
  "Jujur saja, Lei sangat berdedikasi pada pekerjaannya dan dengan setia mengikuti tuntutan yang dibebankan pada perwira politik di era itu: Menjadi bagian dari massa dan selalu berada di garis depan.",
  "Mungkin itu semua hanya pencitraan, tapi dia benar-benar penampil yang baik.",
  "Setiap kali ada pekerjaan sulit dan berbahaya di pangkalan, dia pasti mengajukan diri.",
  "Salah satu tugas yang dia lakukan lebih sering daripada siapa pun adalah memperbaiki kabel arde, tugas yang berbahaya sekaligus melelahkan.",
  "Meskipun pekerjaan ini tidak terlalu menuntut secara teknis, pengalaman sangat membantu.",
  "Ada banyak penyebab kerusakan: kontak yang longgar karena paparan udara terbuka—sulit dideteksi—atau mungkin lokasi masuknya kabel arde ke tebing terlalu kering.",

  "Gergaji itu dibuat dari mata gergaji yang lebih panjang yang dipatahkan menjadi tiga bagian lalu ditumpuk menjadi satu.",

  "One day, the security platoon commander asked Ye to come to the gatehouse at the entrance to the base.",
  "When she entered the gatehouse, she was surprised to see three children: two boys and a girl, about fifteen or sixteen.",
  "They all wore old coats and dog fur hats, obviously locals.",
  "The guard on duty told her that they came from the village of Qijiatun.",
  "They had heard that the people on Radar Peak were learned and had come to ask some questions related to their studies.",

  "Ye wondered how they dared to come onto Radar Peak.",
  "This was a restricted military zone, and the guards were authorized to warn intruders only once before shooting.",
  "The guard saw that Ye was puzzled and explained that they had just received orders that Red Coast Base’s security rating had been reduced.",

  "One of the children took out a worn-out middle school physics textbook.",
  "His hands were dirty and cracked like tree bark.",

  "Only after a while did she realize that the children were still waiting with their books held up.",
  "She hurriedly answered their question, explaining that it was due to air resistance reaching equilibrium against the force of gravity.",
  "Then she promised that if they encountered any difficulties in their studies in the future, they could always come to her for help.",

  "Three days later, seven children came to seek Ye.",
  "In addition to the three who had come last time, there were four more from villages located even farther away.",
  "The third time, fifteen children came to find her, and even a teacher at a small-town high school came along.",
  "",
  "Because there was a shortage of teachers, he had to teach physics, math, and chemistry, and he came to ask Ye for some help on teaching.",
  "The man was over fifty years old, and his face was already full of wrinkles.",

  "After they left the gatehouse, Ye heard him say to the students: “Children, that was a scientist.",
  "A real, bona fide scientist!”",

  "After that, children would come to her for tutoring every few days.",
  "Sometimes there were so many of them that the gatehouse couldn’t accommodate them all.",
  "With the permission of the officers in charge of base security, the guards would escort them to the cafeteria.",
  "There, Ye put up a small blackboard and taught the children.",

  "It was dark by the time Ye got off work on the eve of Chinese New Year, 1980.",
  "Most people at the base had already left Radar Peak for the three-day holiday, and it was quiet everywhere.",
  "Ye returned to her room.",
  "This was once the home of her and Yang Weining, but now it was empty, her only companion the unborn child within her.",
  "In the night outside, the cold wind of the Greater Khingan Mountains screamed, carrying with it the faint sound of firecrackers going off in the village of Qijiatun.",
  "Loneliness pressed down on Ye like a giant hand, and she felt herself being crushed; compressed until she was so small that she disappeared into an invisible corner of the universe.",
  "…",
  "",
  "Just then, someone knocked on her door.",
  "When she opened it, Ye first saw the guard, and then, behind him, the fire of several pine branch torches flickering in the cold wind.",
  "The torches were held aloft by a crowd of children, their faces bright red from the cold, and icicles hung from their hats.",
  "When they came into her room, they seemed to bring the cold air in with them.",
  "Two of the boys, thinly dressed, had suffered the most.",
  "They had taken off their thick coats and wrapped them around something that they carried in their arms.",
  "Unwrapping the coats revealed a large pot, the fermented cabbage and pork dumplings inside still steaming hot.",

  "Because the baby was malpositioned and her body was weak, the base clinic couldn’t handle her case and had to send her to the nearest town hospital.",
  "",
  "This became one of the hardest times in Ye’s life.",
  "After enduring a great deal of pain and losing a large amount of blood, she sank into a coma.",
  "Through a blur she could only see three hot, blinding suns slowly orbiting around her, cruelly roasting her body.",
  "This state lasted for some time, and she hazily thought it was probably the end for her.",
  "It was her hell.",
  "The fire of the three suns would torment her and burn her forever.",
  "This was punishment for her betrayal, the betrayal that exceeded all others.",
  "She sank into terror: not for her, but for her unborn child—was the child still in her?",
  "Or had she already been born into this hell to suffer eternally with her?",
  "",
  "She didn’t know how much time had passed.",
  "Gradually the three suns moved farther away.",
  "After a certain distance, they suddenly shrank and turned into crystalline flying stars.",
  "The air around her cooled, and her pain lessened.",
  "She finally awoke.",
  "",
  "Ye heard a cry next to her.",
  "Turning her head with great effort, she saw the baby’s pink, wet, little face.",
  "",
  "The doctor told Ye that she had lost more than 2,000 ml of blood.",
  "Dozens of peasants from Qijiatun had come to donate blood to her.",
  "Many of the peasants had children who Ye had tutored, but most had no connection to her at all, having only heard her name from the children and their parents.",
  "Without them, she would certainly have died.",
  "",
  "Ye’s living situation became a problem after the birth of her child.",
  "The difficult birth had damaged her health.",
  "It was impossible for her to stay at the base with the baby all by herself, and she had no relatives who could help.",
  "Just then, an old couple living in Qijiatun came to talk to the base leaders and explained that they could take Ye and her baby home with them and take care of them.",
  "The old man used to be a hunter and also gathered some herbs for traditional medicine.",
  "Later, after the forest around the area was lost to logging, the couple had turned to farming, but people still called him Hunter Qi out of habit.",
  "They had two sons and two daughters.",
  "The daughters were married and had moved out.",
  "One of the sons was a soldier away from home, and the other was married and lived with them.",
  "The daughter-in-law had also just given birth.",
  "",
  "Ye still hadn’t been rehabilitated politically, and the base leadership was unsure about this suggested solution.",
  "But in the end, there was no other way, and so they allowed the couple to take Ye and the baby home from the hospital on a sled.",
  "",
  "Ye lived for more than half a year with this peasant family in the Greater Khingan Mountains.",
  "She was so weak after giving birth that her milk did not come in.",
  "During this time, the baby girl, Yang Dong, was breastfed by all the women of the village.",
  "The one who nursed her the most was Hunter Qi’s daughter-in-law, called Feng.",
  "Feng had the strong, solid frame of the women of the Northeast.",
  "She ate sorghum every day, and her large breasts were full of milk even though she was feeding two babies at the same time.",
  "Other nursing women in Qijiatun also came to feed Yang Dong.",
  "They liked her, saying that the baby had the same clever air as her mother.",
  "",
  "Gradually, Hunter Qi’s home became the gathering place for all the women of the village.",
  "Old and young, matrons and maidens, they all liked to stop by when they had nothing else going on.",
  "They admired Ye and were curious about her, and she found that she had many women’s topics to discuss with them.",
  "",
  "On countless days, Ye held Yang Dong and sat with the other women of the village in the yard, surrounded by birch posts.",
  "Next to her was a lazy black dog and the playing children, bathing in the warm sunlight.",
  "She paid attention especially to the women with the copper tobacco pipes.",
  "Leisurely, they blew smoke out of their mouths, and the smoke, filled with sunlight, gave off a silvery glow much like the fine hairs on their plump limbs.",
  "One time, one of them handed her the long-stemmed cupronickel pipe and told her it would make her feel better.",
  "She took only two hits before she became dizzy, and they laughed about it for several days.",
  "",
  "As for the men, Ye had little to say to them.",
  "The matters that occupied them all day also seemed outside her understanding.",
  "She gathered that they were interested in planting some ginseng for cash while the government seemed to be relaxing policies a little, but they didn’t quite have the courage to try.",
  "They all treated Ye with great respect and were very polite toward her.",
  "She didn’t pay much attention to this at first.",
  "But after a while, after observing how those men roughly beat their wives and flirted outrageously with the widows in the village, saying things that made her blush, she finally realized how precious their respect was.",
  "Every few days, one of them would bring a hare or pheasant he had caught to Hunter Qi’s home.",
  "They also gave Yang Dong strange and quaint toys that they’d made with their own hands.",
  "",
  "In Ye’s memory, these months seemed to belong to someone else, like a segment of another life that had drifted into hers like a feather.",
  "This period condensed in her memory into a series of classical paintings—not Chinese brush paintings but European oil paintings.",
  "Chinese brush paintings are full of blank spaces, but life in Qijiatun had no blank spaces.",
  "Like classical oil paintings, it was filled with thick, rich, solid colors.",
  "Everything was warm and intense: the heated kang stove-beds lined with thick layers of ura sedge, the Guandong and Mohe tobacco stuffed in copper pipes, the thick and heavy sorghum meal, the sixty-five-proof baijiu distilled from sorghum—all of these blended into a quiet and peaceful life, like the creek at the edge of the village.",
  "",
  "Most memorable to Ye were the evenings.",
  "Hunter Qi’s son was away in the city selling mushrooms—the first to leave the village to earn money elsewhere, so she shared a room in his house with Feng.",
  "Back then, there was no electricity in the village, and every evening, the two huddled around a kerosene lamp.",
  "Ye would read while Feng did her needlework.",
  "Ye would lean closer and closer to the lamp without noticing, and her bangs would often get singed, at which point the two of them would glance up and smile at each other.",
  "Feng, of course, never had this happen to her.",
  "She had very sharp eyes, and could do detailed work even in the dim light from heating charcoal.",
  "The two babies, not even half a year old, would be sleeping together on the kang next to them.",
  "Ye loved to watch them sleep, their even breathing the only sound in the room.",
  "",
  "At first, Ye did not like sleeping on the heated kang, and often got sick, but she gradually got used to it.",
  "As she slept, she would imagine herself becoming a baby sleeping in someone’s warm lap.",
  "The person who held her wasn’t her father or mother, or her dead husband.",
  "She didn’t know who it was.",
  "The feeling was so real that she would wake up with tears on her face.",
  "",
  "One time, she put down her book and saw that Feng was holding the cloth shoe she was stitching over her knee and staring into the kerosene lamp without moving.",
  "When she realized that Ye was looking at her, Feng asked, “Sister, why do you think the stars in the sky don’t fall down?”",
  "",
  "Ye examined Feng.",
  "The kerosene lamp was a wonderful artist and created a classical painting with dignified colors and bright strokes: Feng had her coat draped over her shoulders, exposing her red belly-band, and a strong, graceful arm.",
  "The glow from the kerosene lamp painted her figure with vivid, warm colors, while the rest of the room dissolved into a gentle darkness.",
  "Close attention revealed a dim red glow, which didn’t come from the kerosene lamp, but the heating charcoal on the ground.",
  "The cold air outside sculpted beautiful ice patterns on the windowpanes with the room’s warm, humid air.",
  "",
  "“You’re afraid of the stars falling down?”",
  "Ye asked softly.",
  "",
  "Feng laughed and shook her head.",
  "“What’s there to be afraid of?",
  "They’re so tiny.”",
  "",
  "Ye did not give her the answer of an astrophysicist.",
  "She only said, “They’re very, very far away.",
  "They can’t fall.”",
  "",
  "Feng was satisfied with this answer, and went back to her needlework.",
  "But Ye could no longer be at peace.",
  "She put down her book and lay down on the warm surface of the kang, closing her eyes.",
  "In her imagination, the rest of the universe around their tiny cottage disappeared, just the way the kerosene lamp hid most of the room in darkness.",
  "Then she substituted the universe in Feng’s heart for the real one.",
  "The night sky was a black dome that was just large enough to cover the entirety of the world.",
  "The surface of the dome was inlaid with countless stars shining with a crystalline silver light, none of which was bigger than the mirror on the old wooden table next to the bed.",
  "The world was flat and extended very far in each direction, but ultimately there was an edge where it met the sky.",
  "The flat surface was covered with mountain ranges like the Greater Khingan Mountains, and with forests dotted with tiny villages, just like Qijiatun.",
  "… This toy-box-like universe comforted Ye, and gradually it shifted from her imagination into her dreams.",
  "",
  "In this tiny mountain hamlet deep in the Greater Khingan Mountains, something finally thawed in Ye Wenjie’s heart.",
  "In the frozen tundra of her soul, a tiny, clear lake of meltwater appeared.",
  "",
  "*   *   *",
  "",
  "Ye eventually returned to Red Coast Base with Yang Dong.",
  "Another two years passed, divided between anxiety and peace.",
  "Ye then received a notice: Both she and her father had been politically rehabilitated.",
  "Soon after, a letter arrived for her from Tsinghua, stating that she could return to teach right away.",
  "Accompanying the letter was a sum of money: the back pay owed to her father after his rehabilitation.",
  "Finally, at base meetings, her supervisors could call her comrade.",
  "",
  "Ye faced all these changes with equanimity, showing no sign of excitement or elation.",
  "She had no interest in the outside world, only wanting to stay at the quiet, out-of-the-way Red Coast Base.",
  "But for the sake of Yang Dong’s education, she finally left the base that she had once thought would be her home for the rest of her life, and returned to her alma mater.",
  "",
  "Leaving the mountains, Ye felt spring was everywhere.",
  "The cold winter of the Cultural Revolution really was over, and everything was springing back to life.",
  "Even though the calamity had just ended, everything was in ruins, and countless men and women were licking their wounds.",
  "The dawn of a new life was already evident.",
  "Students with children of their own appeared on college campuses; bookstores sold out of famous literary works; technological innovation became the focus in factories; and scientific research now enjoyed a sacred halo.",
  "Science and technology were the only keys to opening the door to the future, and people approached science with the faith and sincerity of elementary school students.",
  "Though their efforts were naïve, they were also down-to-earth.",
  "At the first National Conference on Science, Guo Moruo, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, declared that it was the season of rebirth and renewal for China’s battered science establishment.",
  "",
  "Was this the end of the madness?",
  "Were science and rationality really coming back?",
  "Ye asked herself these questions repeatedly.",
  "",
  "Ye never again received any communication from Trisolaris.",
  "She knew that she would have to wait at least eight years to hear that world’s response to her message, and after leaving the base, she no longer had any way of receiving extraterrestrial replies.",
  "",
  "It was such an important thing, and yet she had done it all by herself.",
  "This gave her a sense of unreality.",
  "As time passed, that sense grew ever stronger.",
  "What had happened resembled an illusion, a dream.",
  "Could the sun really amplify radio signals?",
  "Did she really use it as an antenna to send a message about human civilization into the universe?",
  "Did she really receive a message from the stars?",
  "Did that blood-hued morning, when she had betrayed the entire human race, really happen?",
  "And those murders …",
  "",
  "Ye tried to numb herself with work so as to forget the past—and almost succeeded.",
  "A strange kind of self-protective instinct caused her to stop recalling the past, to stop thinking about the communication she had once had with another civilization.",
  "Her life passed this way, day after day, in tranquility.",

  "After she had been back at Tsinghua for a while, Ye took Dong Dong to see her grandmother, Shao Lin.",
  "After her husband’s death, Shao had soon recovered from her mental breakdown and found ways to survive in the tiny cracks of politics.",
  "Her attempts to chase the political winds and shout the right slogans finally paid off, and later, during the “Return to Class, Continue the Revolution” phase, she went back to teaching (*36).",
  "",
  "*36- Translator’s Note: During the initial phase of the Cultural Revolution, all classes ceased at colleges and elementary, junior high, and high schools as older students became Red Guards.",

  "But then Shao did something that no one expected.",
  "She married a persecuted high-level cadre from the Education Ministry.",
  "At that time, the cadre still lived in a “cowshed” for reform through labor (*37).",

  "Half a year after her return to Tsinghua, Ye took on an important task: the design of a large radio astronomy observatory.",
  "She and the task force traveled around the country to find the best site for the observatory.",
  "The initial considerations were purely technical.",
  "Unlike traditional astronomy, radio astronomy didn’t have as many demands on atmospheric quality, but required minimal electromagnetic interference.",
  "They traveled to many places and finally picked a place with the cleanest electromagnetic environment: a remote, hilly area in the Northwest.",
  "",
  "The loess hills here had little vegetation cover.",
  "Rifts from erosion made the slopes look like old faces full of wrinkles.",
  "After selecting a few possible sites, the task force stayed for a brief rest at a village where most of the inhabitants still lived in traditional cave dwellings.",
  "The village’s production team leader recognized Ye as an educated person and asked her whether she knew how to speak a foreign language.",
  "She asked him which foreign language, and he said he didn’t know.",
  "However, if she did know a foreign tongue, he would send someone up the hill to call down Bethune, because the production team needed to discuss something with him (*41).",
  "",
  "*41- Translator’s Note: Norman Bethune (1890–1939) was a Canadian surgeon who served with the Chinese Communists in their fight against the Japanese invasion force during World War II.",
  "As one of the few Westerners who showed friendship to the Chinese Communists, Bethune became a Chinese hero known to the elderly and children alike.",
  "",

  "Ye was amazed.",
  "",
  "“We don’t know the foreigner’s real name, so we just call him that.”",
  "",
  "“Is he a doctor?”",

  "“No.",
  "He’s planting trees up in the hills.",
  "Has been at it for almost three years.”",
  "",
  "“Planting trees?",
  "What for?”",
  "",
  "“He says it’s for the birds.",
  "A kind of bird that he says is almost extinct.”",
  "",
  "Ye and her colleagues were curious and asked the production team leader to bring them for a visit.",
  "They followed a trail until they were on top of a small hillock.",
  "The team leader showed them a place among the barren loess hills.",
  "Ye felt it brighten before her eyes.",
  "There was a slope covered by green forests, as though an old, yellowing canvas had been accidentally blessed with a splash of green paint.",
  "",
  "Ye and the others soon saw the foreigner.",
  "Other than his blond hair and green eyes and tattered jeans and a jacket that reminded her of a cowboy, he didn’t look too different from the local peasants who had labored all their lives.",
  "Even his skin had the same dark hue from the sun as the locals.",
  "He didn’t show much interest in the visitors.",
  "He introduced himself as Mike Evans without mentioning his nationality, but his English was clearly American-accented.",
  "He lived in a simple two-room adobe hut, which was filled with tools for planting trees: hoes, shovels, saws for pruning tree branches, and so on, all of which were locally made and crude.",
  "The dust that permeated the Northwest lay in a thin layer over his simple and rough-hewn bed and kitchen implements.",
  "A pile of books, most of which dealt with biology, sat on his bed.",
  "Ye noticed a copy of Peter Singer’s Animal Liberation.",
  "The only sign of modernity was a small radio set, hooked up to an external D battery.",
  "There was also an old telescope.",

  "",
  "“Save … save the locals?",
  "It’s true that the ecological conditions here—”",
  "",
  "“Why are you all like this?”",
  "Evans suddenly became furious.",
  "“Why does one have to save people to be considered a hero?",
  "Why is saving other species considered insignificant?",
  "Who gave humans such high honors?",
  "No, humans do not need saving.",
  "They’re already living much better than they deserve.”",
  "",
  "“We heard that you are trying to save a type of bird.”",
  "",
  "“Yes, a swallow.",
  "It’s a subspecies of the northwestern brown swallow.",
  "The Latin name is very long, so I won’t bore you with it.",
  "Every spring, they follow ancient, established migratory paths to return from the south.",
  "They nest only here, but as the forest disappears year after year, they can no longer find the trees in which to build their nests.",
  "When I discovered them, the species had less than ten thousand individuals left.",
  "If the trend continues, within five years it will be extinct.",
  "The trees I’ve planted now provide a habitat for some of them, and the population is rising again.",
  "I must plant more trees and expand this Eden.”",
  "",
  "Evans allowed Ye and the others to look through his telescope.",
  "With his help, they finally saw a few tiny black birds darting through the trees.",
  "",
  "“Not very pretty, are they?",
  "Of course, they’re not as crowd-pleasing as giant pandas.",
  "Every day on this planet some species that doesn’t draw the attention of humans goes extinct.”",
  "",
  "“Did you plant all of these trees by yourself?”",
  "",
  "“Most of them.",
  "Initially I hired some locals to help, but soon I ran out of money.",
  "Saplings and irrigation all cost a lot—but you know something?",
  "My father is a billionaire.",
  "He is the president of an international oil company, but he will not give me any more funding, and I don’t want to use his money anymore.”",
  "",
  "Now that Evans had opened up, he seemed to want to pour his heart out.",
  "“When I was twelve, a thirty-thousand-ton oil tanker from my father’s company ran aground along the Atlantic coast.",
  "More than twenty thousand tons of crude oil spilled into the ocean.",
  "At the time, my family was staying at a coastal vacation home not too far from the site of the accident.",
  "After my father heard the news, the first thing he thought of was how to avoid responsibility and minimize damage to the company.",
  "",
  "“That afternoon, I went to see the hellish coast.",
  "The sea was black, and the waves, under the sticky, thick film of oil, were smooth and weak.",
  "The beach was also covered by a black layer of crude oil.",
  "Some volunteers and I searched for birds on the beach that were still alive.",
  "They struggled in the sticky oil, looking like black statues made out of asphalt, only their eyes proving that they were still alive.",
  "Those eyes staring out of the oil still haunt my dreams to this day.",
  "We soaked those birds in detergent, trying to get rid of the oil stuck to their bodies.",
  "But it was extremely difficult: crude oil was infused into their feathers, and if you brushed a little too hard, the feathers would come off with the oil.",
  "… By that evening, most of the birds had died.",
  "As I sat on the black beach, exhausted and covered in oil, I stared at the sun setting over a black sea and felt like it was the end of the world.",
  "",
  "“My father came up behind me without my noticing.",
  "He asked me if I still remembered the small dinosaur skeleton.",
  "Of course I remembered.",
  "The nearly complete skeleton had been discovered during oil exploration.",
  "My father spent a large sum to buy it, and installed it on the grounds of my grandfather’s mansion.",
  "",
  "“My father then said, ‘Mike, I’ve told you how dinosaurs went extinct.",
  "An asteroid crashed into the Earth.",
  "The world first became a sea of fire, and then sank into a prolonged period of darkness and coldness.",
  "… One night, you woke from a nightmare, saying that you had dreamt that you were back in that terrifying age.",
  "Let me tell you now what I wanted to tell you that night: If you really lived during the Cretaceous Period, you’d be fortunate.",
  "The period we live in now is far more frightening.",
  "Right now, species on Earth are going extinct far faster than during the late Cretaceous.",
  "Now is truly the age of mass extinctions!",
  "So, my child, what you’re seeing is nothing.",
  "This is only an insignificant episode in a much vaster process.",
  "We can have no sea birds, but we can’t be without oil.",
  "Can you imagine life without oil?",
  "Your last birthday, I gave you that lovely Ferrari and promised you that you could drive it after you turned fifteen.",
  "But without oil, it would be a pile of junk metal and you’d never drive it.",
  "Right now, if you want to visit your grandfather, you can get there on my personal jet and cross the ocean in a dozen hours or so.",
  "But without oil, you’d have to tumble in a sailboat for more than a month.",
  "… These are the rules of the game of civilization: The first priority is to guarantee the existence of the human race and their comfortable life.",
  "Everything else is secondary.’",
  "",
  "“My father placed a great deal of hope in me, but in the end I didn’t turn out the way he wanted.",
  "In the days after that, the eyes of those drowned birds always followed me and determined my life.",
  "When I was thirteen, my father asked me what I wanted to do when I grew up.",
  "I said I wanted to save lives.",
  "My dream wasn’t that great.",
  "I only wanted to save a species near extinction.",
  "It could be a bird that wasn’t very pretty, a drab butterfly, or a beetle that no one would even notice.",
  "Later, I studied biology, and became a specialist on birds and insects.",
  "The way I see it, my ideal is worthy.",
  "Saving a species of bird or insect is no different from saving humankind.",
  "‘All lives are equal’ is the basic tenet of Pan-Species Communism.”",
  "",
  "“What?”",
  "Ye wasn’t sure she had heard the last term correctly.",
  "",
  "“Pan-Species Communism.",
  "It’s an ideology I invented.",
  "Or maybe you can call it a faith.",
  "Its core belief is that all species on Earth are created equal.”",
  "",
  "“That is an impractical ideal.",
  "Our crops are also living species.",
  "If humans are to survive, that kind of equality is impossible.”",
  "",
  "“Slave owners must also have thought that about their slaves in the distant past.",
  "And don’t forget technology—there will be a day when humanity can manufacture food.",
  "We should lay down the ideological and theoretical foundation long before that.",
  "Indeed, Pan-Species Communism is a natural continuation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.",
  "The French Revolution was two hundred years ago, and we haven’t even taken a step beyond that.",
  "From this we can see the hypocrisy and selfishness of the human race.”",
  "",
  "“How long do you intend to stay here?”",
  "",
  "“I don’t know.",
  "I’m prepared to devote my life to the task.",
  "The feeling is beautiful.",
  "Of course, I don’t expect you to understand.”",
  "",
  "Evans seemed to lose interest.",
  "He said that he had to go back to work, so he picked up a shovel and a saw and then left.",
  "When he said good-bye, he glanced at Ye again, as though there was something unusual about her.",
  "",
  "On the way back, one of Ye’s colleagues recited from Chairman Mao’s essay “Remembering Bethune”: “‘Noble-minded and pure, a man of moral integrity and above vulgar interests.’”",
  "He sighed.",
  "“There really are people who can live like that.”",
  "",
  "Others also expressed their admiration and conflicted feelings.",
  "Ye seemed to be speaking to herself as she said, “If there were more men like him, even just a few more, things would have turned out differently.”",
  "",
  "Of course, no one understood what she really meant.",
  "",
  "The task force leader turned the conversation back to their work.",
  "“I think this site isn’t going to work.",
  "Our superiors won’t approve it.”",
  "",
  "“Why not?",
  "Of the four possible sites, this has the best electromagnetic environment.”",
  "",
  "“What about the human environment?",
  "Comrades, don’t just focus on the technical side.",
  "Look at how poor this place is.",
  "The poorer a village, the craftier the people.",
  "Do you understand?",
  "If the observatory were located here, there would be trouble between the scientists and the locals.",
  "I can imagine the peasants thinking of the astronomy complex as a juicy piece of meat that they can take bites from.”",
  "",
  "This site was indeed not approved, and the reason was just what the task force leader had said.",
  "",
  "*   *   *",

  "Three years passed without Ye hearing anything more about Evans.",
  "",
  "But one spring day, Ye received a postcard from Evans with only a single line: “Come here.",
  "Tell me how to go on.”",
  "",
  "Ye rode the train for a day and a night, and then switched to a bus for many hours until she arrived at the village nestled in the remote hills of the Northwest.",
  "",
  "As soon as she climbed onto that small hillock, she saw the forest again.",
  "Because the trees had grown, it now seemed far denser, but Ye noticed that the forest had once been much bigger.",
  "Newer parts that had grown in the past few years had already been cut.",
  "",
  "The logging was in full swing.",
  "In every direction, trees were falling.",
  "The entire forest seemed like a mulberry leaf being devoured by silkworms on all sides.",
  "At the current rate, it would disappear soon.",
  "The workers doing the logging came from two nearby villages.",
  "Using axes and saws, they cut down those barely grown trees one by one, and then dragged them off the hill using tractors and ox carts.",
  "There were many loggers, and fights frequently erupted among them.",
  "",
  "The fall of each small tree didn’t make much sound, and there was no loud buzzing from chain saws, but the almost-familiar scene made Ye’s chest tighten.",
  "",
  "Someone called out to her—that production team leader, now the village chief.",
  "He recognized Ye.",
  "When she asked him why they were cutting down the forest, he said, “This forest isn’t protected by law.”",
  "",
  "“How can that be?",
  "The Forestry Law has just been promulgated.”",
  "",
  "“But who ever gave Bethune permission to plant trees here?",
  "A foreigner coming here to plant trees without approval would not be protected by any law.”",
  "",
  "“You can’t think that way.",
  "He was planting on the barren hills and didn’t take up any arable land.",
  "Also, back when he started, you didn’t object.”",
  "",
  "“That’s true.",
  "The county actually gave him an award for planting the trees.",
  "The villagers originally planned to cut down the forest in a few more years—it’s best to wait until the pig is fat before slaughtering it, am I right?",
  "But those people from Nange Village can’t wait any longer, and if my village doesn’t join in, we won’t get any.”",
  "",
  "“You must stop immediately.",
  "I will go to the government to report this!”",
  "",
  "“There’s no need.”",

  "“See that?",
  "That’s from the deputy secretary of the County Forestry Bureau.",
  "And there are also people here from the town police department.",
  "They’ve carried off more trees than anyone else!",
  "I told you, these trees have no status and aren’t protected.",

  "Also, comrade, aren’t you a college professor?",
  "What does this have to do with you?”",

  "The adobe hut looked the same, but Evans wasn’t inside.",
  "Ye found him in the woods holding an ax and carefully pruning a tree.",

  "Evans stopped and stared at Ye in surprise.",
  "Light from the setting sun slanted through the trees and made his eyes sparkle.",
  "“Ye, do you really think I’m doing this because of this forest?”",
  "He laughed and shook his head, then dropped the ax.",
  "He sat down, his back against a tree.",
  "“If I want to stop them, it’d be easy.",
  "I just returned from America.",
  "My father died two months ago, and I inherited most of his money.",
  "My brother and sister only got five million each.",
  "This wasn’t what I expected at all.",
  "Maybe in his heart, he still respected me.",
  "Or maybe he respected my ideals.",
  "Not including fixed assets, do you know how much money I have at my disposal?",
  "About four point five billion dollars.",

  "“You’re thinking of Buddhism?”",

  "“Yes.",
  "The focus of Christianity is Man.",
  "Even though all the species were placed into Noah’s Ark, other species were never given the same status as humans.",

  "Consequently, it was only within the last two years that they had begun to attack the ETO effectively.",
  "",
  "The members of the ETO were not of a single mind.",
  "Within the organization were complicated factions and divisions of opinion.",
  "Mainly, they fell into two factions.",
  "",
  "The Adventist group was the purest, most fundamentalist strand of the ETO, comprised mainly of believers in Evans’s Pan-Species Communism.",
  "They had completely given up hope in human nature.",
  "This despair began with the mass extinctions of the Earth’s species caused by modern civilization.",
  "Later, other Adventists based their hatred of the human race on other foundations, not limited to issues such as the environment or warfare.",
  "Some raised their hatred to very abstract, philosophical levels.",
  "Unlike how they would be imagined later, most of them were realists, and did not place too much hope in the alien civilization they served either.",
  "Their betrayal was based only on their despair and hatred of the human race.",
  "Mike Evans gave the Adventists their motto: We don’t know what extraterrestrial civilization is like, but we know humanity.",
  "",
  "The Redemptionists didn’t appear until long after the ETO’s founding.",
  "This group’s nature was a religious organization, and the members were believers in the Trisolaran faith.",
  "",
  "A civilization outside the human race would doubtlessly greatly attract the highly educated classes, and it was easy for them to develop many beautiful fantasies about such a civilization.",
  "The human race was a naïve species, and the attraction posed by a more advanced alien civilization was almost irresistible.",
  "To make an imperfect analogy: Human civilization was like a young, unworldly person walking alone across the desert of the universe, who has found out about the existence of a potential lover.",
  "Though the person could not see the potential lover’s face or figure, the knowledge that the other person existed somewhere in the distance created lovely fantasies about the potential lover that spread like wildfire.",
  "Gradually, as fantasies about that distant civilization grew more and more elaborate, the Redemptionists developed spiritual feelings toward Trisolaran civilization.",
  "Alpha Centauri became Mount Olympus in space, the dwelling place of the gods; and so the Trisolaran religion—which really had nothing to do with religion on Trisolaris—was born.",
  "Unlike other human religions, they worshipped something that truly existed.",
  "Also unlike other human religions, it was the Lord who was in crisis, and the duty of salvation fell on the shoulders of the believer.",
  "",
  "The main path of spreading Trisolaran culture to society was the Three Body game.",
  "The ETO invested enormous effort to develop this massive piece of software.",
  "The initial goals were twofold: one, to proselytize the Trisolaran religion; and two, to allow the tentacles of the ETO to spread from the highly educated intelligentsia to the lower social strata, and recruit younger ETO members from the middle and lower classes.",
  "",
  "Using a shell that drew elements from human society and history, the game explained the culture and history of Trisolaris, thus avoiding alienating beginners.",
  "Once a player had advanced to a certain level and had begun to appreciate Trisolaran civilization, the ETO would establish contact, examine the player’s sympathies, and finally recruit those who passed the tests to be members of the ETO.",
  "But Three Body didn’t attract much notice, because the game required too much background knowledge and in-depth thinking, and most young players didn’t have the patience or skill to discover the shocking truth beneath its apparently common surface.",
  "Those who were attracted by it were still mostly intellectuals.",
  "",
  "Most of those who became Redemptionists got to know Trisolaran civilization through the Three Body game, and so Three Body could be said to be the cradle of the Redemptionists.",
  "",
  "While the Redemptionists developed religious feelings toward Trisolaran civilization, they were also not as extreme as the Adventists in their attitude toward human civilization.",
  "Their ultimate ideal was to save the Lord.",
  "In order to allow the Lord to continue to exist, they were willing to sacrifice the human world to some degree.",
  "But most of them believed that the ideal solution would be to find a way to allow the Lord to continue to live in the Trisolaris stellar system and avoid the invasion of the Earth.",
  "Naïvely, they believed that solving the three-body problem would achieve this goal, saving both Trisolaris and the Earth.",
  "Admittedly, perhaps this thought wasn’t all that naïve.",
  "Trisolaran civilization itself had thought so through many eons.",
  "The effort to solve the three-body problem was a thread that ran through several hundreds of cycles of Trisolaran civilization.",
  "Most Redemptionists with some in-depth math and physics knowledge had attempted the three-body problem, and even after knowing that the problem was mathematically unsolvable as posed, the effort did not cease, because solving the three-body problem had become a religious ritual of their faith.",
  "Even though the Redemptionists had many first-class physicists and mathematicians, research in this area never yielded any important results.",
  "It took someone like Wei Cheng, a prodigy who had no connection to the ETO or the Trisolaran faith, to accidentally come up with a breakthrough in which the Redemptionists placed much hope.",
  "",
  "The Adventists and the Redemptionists were always in sharp conflict.",
  "The Adventists believed that the Redemptionists were the greatest threat to the ETO.",
  "This view wasn’t without reason: It was only through some Redemptionists who had a sense of duty that the governments of the world gradually came to understand the shocking background of the ETO rebels.",
  "The two factions were of approximately equal strength within the organization, and the armed forces of both had developed to the point of starting a civil war.",
  "Ye Wenjie used her authority and reputation to try to patch over the division between the two, but the result was never ideal.",
  "",
  "As the ETO movement continued to develop, a third faction appeared: the Survivors.",
  "After confirming the existence of the alien invasion fleet, surviving that war became a most natural human desire.",
  "Of course, that war wouldn’t occur for another 450 years, and had nothing to do with those living today, but many people hoped that if humans did lose, at least their descendants who were alive in four and a half centuries could live on.",
  "Serving the Trisolaran invaders would clearly help with this goal.",
  "Compared to the other two factions, the Survivors tended to come from the lower social classes, and most were from the East, and especially from China.",
  "Their numbers were still small, but they were growing rapidly.",
  "As Trisolaran culture continued to spread, they would become a force that could not be ignored in the future.",
  "",
  "The ETO members’ alienation developed variously from the faults of human civilization itself, the yearning and adoration for a more advanced civilization, and the strong desire for one’s descendants to survive that final war.",
  "These three powerful motives propelled the ETO movement to develop rapidly.",
  "",
  "By then, the extraterrestrial civilization was still in the depths of space, more than four light-years away, separated from the human world by a long journey of four and a half centuries.",
  "The only thing they had sent to the Earth was a radio transmission.",

  "",
  "ETO disebut sebagai organisasi para bangsawan spiritual.",
  "Sebagian besar anggotanya berasal dari kalangan berpendidikan tinggi, dan banyak di antaranya adalah elite di bidang politik maupun keuangan.",
  "ETO pernah mencoba merekrut anggota dari kalangan rakyat biasa, tetapi semua upaya ini gagal.",
  "ETO menyimpulkan bahwa rakyat biasa tampaknya tidak memiliki pemahaman yang menyeluruh dan mendalam seperti kaum terpelajar mengenai sisi gelap kemanusiaan.",
  "Lebih penting lagi, karena pemikiran mereka tidak terlalu dipengaruhi oleh sains dan filsafat modern, mereka masih merasakan identifikasi naluriah yang luar biasa kuat terhadap spesies mereka sendiri.",
  "Mengkhianati umat manusia secara keseluruhan adalah hal yang tak terbayangkan bagi mereka.",
  "Namun, para elite intelektual berbeda: Sebagian besar dari mereka sudah mulai memandang berbagai masalah dari sudut pandang di luar ras manusia.",
  "Peradaban manusia akhirnya melahirkan kekuatan alienasi yang tangguh.",
  "",
  "Betapapun mencengangkannya kecepatan pertumbuhan ETO, jumlah anggota tidak menceritakan seluruh kekuatan ETO.",

  "",
  "Sebagai panglima tertinggi pemberontak ETO, Ye hanyalah pemimpin spiritual mereka.",
  "Dia tidak terlibat dalam detail operasional organisasi, tidak tahu bagaimana ETO bisa tumbuh begitu besar, dan bahkan tidak mengetahui jumlah pasti anggotanya.",
  "",
  "Agar dapat berkembang pesat, organisasi ini beroperasi secara semi-terbuka, namun pemerintahan dunia tidak pernah terlalu menaruh perhatian pada ETO.",
  "ETO tahu bahwa mereka akan terlindungi oleh konservatisme dan kurangnya imajinasi pemerintah.",
  "Di dalam badan-badan yang memegang kekuasaan negara, tidak ada yang menanggapi proklamasi ETO dengan serius; mereka mengira ETO sama seperti ekstremis lain yang membualkan omong kosong.",
  "Dan karena status sosial anggotanya, pemerintah selalu memperlakukan mereka dengan hati-hati.",
  "Pada saat organisasi ini diakui sebagai ancaman, para pemberontak sudah ada di mana-mana.",
  "Baru ketika ETO mulai membangun angkatan bersenjata, beberapa badan keamanan nasional mulai memperhatikannya dan menyadari betapa tidak lazimnya organisasi ini.",
  "Akibatnya, baru dalam dua tahun terakhir inilah mereka mulai menyerang ETO secara efektif.",
  "",
  "Anggota ETO tidak memiliki satu pemikiran yang sama.",
  "Di dalam organisasi terdapat faksi-faksi yang rumit dan perpecahan pendapat.",
  "Secara garis besar, mereka terbagi menjadi dua faksi.",
  "",
  "Kelompok Adven adalah aliran paling murni dan paling fundamentalis dalam ETO, yang sebagian besar terdiri dari penganut Komunisme Pan-Spesies ajaran Evans.",
  "Mereka telah sepenuhnya kehilangan harapan pada sifat dasar manusia.",
  "Keputusasaan ini bermula dari kepunahan massal spesies di Bumi yang disebabkan oleh peradaban modern.",
  "Belakangan, kaum Adven lainnya mendasarkan kebencian mereka terhadap umat manusia pada landasan lain, tidak terbatas pada masalah lingkungan atau peperangan saja.",
  "Beberapa mengangkat kebencian mereka ke tingkat filosofis yang sangat abstrak.",
  "Berbeda dengan bayangan orang-orang di kemudian hari, sebagian besar dari mereka adalah kaum realis, dan juga tidak menaruh terlalu banyak harapan pada peradaban asing yang mereka layani.",
  "Pengkhianatan mereka semata-mata didasarkan pada keputusasaan dan kebencian terhadap umat manusia.",
  "Mike Evans memberikan semboyan kepada kaum Adven: Kita tidak tahu seperti apa peradaban luar angkasa itu, tetapi kita tahu seperti apa umat manusia.",
  "",
  "Kaum Penebus baru muncul lama setelah ETO didirikan.",
  "Sifat kelompok ini adalah organisasi keagamaan, dan anggotanya adalah penganut kepercayaan Trisolaris.",
  "",
  "Peradaban di luar ras manusia tak pelak lagi akan sangat menarik bagi kalangan berpendidikan tinggi, dan mudah bagi mereka untuk mengembangkan banyak fantasi indah tentang peradaban semacam itu.",
  "Ras manusia adalah spesies yang naif, dan daya tarik yang ditawarkan oleh peradaban asing yang lebih maju hampir tak tertahankan.",
  "Sebagai analogi yang tidak sempurna: Peradaban manusia ibarat seorang pemuda polos yang berjalan sendirian melintasi gurun semesta, yang baru saja mengetahui keberadaan seorang calon kekasih.",
  "Meskipun orang tersebut tidak dapat melihat wajah atau sosok sang calon kekasih, pengetahuan bahwa orang lain itu ada di suatu tempat di kejauhan menciptakan fantasi-fantasi indah tentangnya yang menyebar bak kebakaran hutan.",
  "Lambat laun, seiring fantasi tentang peradaban jauh itu menjadi semakin rumit, Kaum Penebus mengembangkan perasaan spiritual terhadap peradaban Trisolaris.",
  "Alpha Centauri menjadi Gunung Olympus di angkasa, tempat kediaman para dewa; dan dengan demikian lahirlah agama Trisolaris—yang sebenarnya sama sekali tidak ada hubungannya dengan agama di Trisolaris.",
  "Tidak seperti agama manusia lainnya, mereka memuja sesuatu yang benar-benar ada.",
  "Juga tidak seperti agama manusia lainnya, Sang Gusti-lah yang berada dalam krisis, dan tugas penyelamatan jatuh ke pundak orang yang beriman.",
  "",
  "Jalur utama penyebaran budaya Trisolaris ke masyarakat adalah gim Tiga Bodi.",
  "ETO mengerahkan upaya luar biasa untuk mengembangkan perangkat lunak raksasa ini.",
  "Tujuan awalnya ada dua: pertama, untuk menyebarkan agama Trisolaris; dan kedua, untuk memungkinkan tentakel ETO menyebar dari kaum intelektual berpendidikan tinggi ke strata sosial yang lebih rendah, serta merekrut anggota ETO yang lebih muda dari kelas menengah dan bawah.",
  "",
  "Menggunakan cangkang yang mengambil elemen-elemen dari masyarakat dan sejarah manusia, gim ini menjelaskan budaya dan sejarah Trisolaris, sehingga tidak mengasingkan para pemula.",
  "Begitu seorang pemain mencapai tingkat tertentu dan mulai mengapresiasi peradaban Trisolaris, ETO akan menjalin kontak, memeriksa simpati pemain tersebut, dan akhirnya merekrut mereka yang lulus ujian untuk menjadi anggota ETO.",
  "Namun Tiga Bodi tidak menarik banyak perhatian, karena gim ini menuntut terlalu banyak pengetahuan latar belakang dan pemikiran mendalam, dan sebagian besar pemain muda tidak memiliki kesabaran atau keterampilan untuk menemukan kebenaran mengejutkan di balik permukaannya yang tampak biasa.",
  "Mereka yang tertarik padanya sebagian besar masih kaum intelektual.",
  "",
  "Sebagian besar dari mereka yang menjadi Kaum Penebus mengenal peradaban Trisolaris melalui gim Tiga Bodi, sehingga Tiga Bodi bisa dikatakan sebagai tempat lahirnya Kaum Penebus.",
  "",
  "Meskipun Kaum Penebus mengembangkan perasaan religius terhadap peradaban Trisolaris, sikap mereka terhadap peradaban manusia tidak seekstrem Kaum Adven.",
  "Cita-cita utama mereka adalah menyelamatkan Sang Gusti.",
  "Demi memungkinkan Sang Gusti terus ada, mereka bersedia mengorbankan dunia manusia sampai tingkat tertentu.",
  "Namun sebagian besar dari mereka percaya bahwa solusi idealnya adalah menemukan cara agar Sang Gusti dapat terus hidup di sistem bintang Trisolaris dan menghindari invasi ke Bumi.",
  "Dengan naif, mereka percaya bahwa memecahkan masalah tiga bodi akan mencapai tujuan ini, menyelamatkan Trisolaris maupun Bumi.",
  "Harus diakui, mungkin pemikiran ini tidak sepenuhnya naif.",
  "Peradaban Trisolaris sendiri telah berpikir demikian selama berabad-abad.",
  "Upaya untuk memecahkan masalah tiga bodi adalah benang merah yang menjalin ratusan siklus peradaban Trisolaris.",
  "Sebagian besar Kaum Penebus yang memiliki pengetahuan matematika dan fisika mendalam telah mencoba memecahkan masalah tiga bodi, dan bahkan setelah mengetahui bahwa masalah itu secara matematis tidak dapat dipecahkan seperti yang diajukan, upaya itu tidak berhenti, karena memecahkan masalah tiga bodi telah menjadi ritual keagamaan keyakinan mereka.",
  "Meskipun Kaum Penebus memiliki banyak fisikawan dan matematikawan kelas satu, penelitian di bidang ini tidak pernah membuahkan hasil penting.",
  "Dibutuhkan seseorang seperti Wei Cheng, seorang anak ajaib yang tidak memiliki hubungan dengan ETO atau kepercayaan Trisolaris, untuk secara tidak sengaja menemukan terobosan yang menjadi tumpuan harapan besar Kaum Penebus.",
  "",
  "Kaum Adven dan Kaum Penebus selalu berada dalam konflik tajam.",
  "Kaum Adven percaya bahwa Kaum Penebus adalah ancaman terbesar bagi ETO.",
  "Pandangan ini bukan tanpa alasan: Hanya melalui beberapa anggota Kaum Penebus yang memiliki rasa kewajibanlah pemerintah dunia perlahan-lahan mulai memahami latar belakang mengejutkan para pemberontak ETO.",
  "Kedua faksi tersebut memiliki kekuatan yang kurang lebih seimbang di dalam organisasi, dan angkatan bersenjata keduanya telah berkembang hingga ke titik di mana perang saudara bisa pecah.",
  "Ye Wenjie menggunakan wewenang dan reputasinya untuk mencoba menambal perpecahan di antara keduanya, tetapi hasilnya tidak pernah ideal.",
  "",
  "Seiring gerakan ETO terus berkembang, faksi ketiga muncul: Kaum Penyintas.",
  "Setelah memastikan keberadaan armada invasi asing, bertahan hidup dari perang itu menjadi hasrat manusia yang paling alami.",
  "Tentu saja, perang itu tidak akan terjadi selama 450 tahun lagi, dan tidak ada hubungannya dengan mereka yang hidup hari ini, tetapi banyak orang berharap jika manusia memang kalah, setidaknya keturunan mereka yang hidup empat setengah abad lagi bisa terus bertahan.",
  "Melayani penjajah Trisolaris jelas akan membantu tujuan ini.",
  "Dibandingkan dengan dua faksi lainnya, Kaum Penyintas cenderung berasal dari kelas sosial yang lebih rendah, dan sebagian besar berasal dari Timur, terutama dari Tiongkok.",
  "Jumlah mereka masih kecil, tetapi tumbuh dengan pesat.",
  "Seiring budaya Trisolaris terus menyebar, mereka akan menjadi kekuatan yang tidak bisa diabaikan di masa depan.",
  "",
  "Alienasi anggota ETO berkembang secara bervariasi dari kesalahan peradaban manusia itu sendiri, kerinduan dan pemujaan terhadap peradaban yang lebih maju, serta hasrat kuat agar keturunan seseorang dapat bertahan hidup dalam perang terakhir itu.",
  "Tiga motif kuat ini mendorong gerakan ETO untuk berkembang pesat.",
  "",
  "Pada saat itu, peradaban luar angkasa tersebut masih berada di kedalaman angkasa, lebih dari empat tahun cahaya jauhnya, terpisah dari dunia manusia oleh perjalanan panjang selama empat setengah abad.",
  "Satu-satunya hal yang mereka kirimkan ke Bumi hanyalah transmisi radio.",

  "There was nothing on any frequency.",
  "I think you’ve already confirmed this.",

  "INTERROGATOR: Yes.",
  "In other words—at least as of four years ago—Trisolaris decided to terminate all communications with Earth.",
  "This makes the messages intercepted by the Adventists even more important.",
  "",
  "YE: True.",
  "But there’s really nothing more I can tell you about them.",
  "",
  "INTERROGATOR: (pausing a few seconds) Then let’s find some topic where you can tell me more.",
  "Mike Evans lied to you, is that right?",
  "",
  "YE: You could put it that way.",
  "He never revealed to me the thoughts buried deep in his heart, and only expressed his sense of duty toward the other species on this planet.",
  "I never realized that this sense of duty had caused his hatred of human civilization to develop to such extremes that he could make the destruction of the human race his ultimate ideal.",
  "",
  "INTERROGATOR: Let’s look at the current composition of the ETO.",
  "The Adventists would like to destroy the human race by means of an alien power; the Redemptionists worship the alien civilization as a god; the Survivors wish to betray other humans to buy their own survival.",
  "None of these is in line with your original ideal of using the alien civilization as a way to reform humanity.",
  "",
  "YE: I started the fire, but I couldn’t control how it burnt.",
  "",
  "INTERROGATOR: You had a plan to eliminate the Adventists from within the ETO, and you even began to implement this plan.",
  "But Judgment Day is the core base and command center for the Adventists, and Mike Evans and other Adventist leaders usually reside there.",
  "Why didn’t you attack the ship first?",
  "Most of the armed forces of the Redemptionists are loyal to you, and you should have enough firepower to sink it or capture it.",
  "",
  "YE: It’s because of the messages from the Lord that they intercepted.",
  "All those messages are stored in the Second Red Coast Base, on some computer on Judgment Day.",
  "If we attacked that ship, the Adventists could erase all the messages when they realized that loss was imminent.",
  "Those messages are too important for us to risk losing them.",
  "For Redemptionists, losing those messages would be as if Christians lost the Bible or Muslims lost the Koran.",
  "I think you are faced with the same problem.",
  "The Adventists are holding the Lord’s messages hostage, and that is why Judgment Day has remained unmolested so far.",
  "",
  "INTERROGATOR: Do you have any advice for us?",

  "YE: No.",

  "Are you already a follower of the Trisolaran faith?",
  "",
  "YE: Not at all.",
  "It’s just a habit.",
  "… I do not wish to discuss it further.",
  "",
  "INTERROGATOR: Let’s get back to those intercepted messages.",
  "Maybe you don’t know the exact contents, but surely you must have heard rumors of some of the details?",
  "",
  "YE: Probably only baseless rumors.",
  "",
  "INTERROGATOR: Such as?",
  "",
  "YE:…",
  "",
  "INTERROGATOR: Did Trisolaris transfer certain technologies to the Adventists, technologies more advanced than current human technology?",

  "YE: Not likely.",
  "Because such technology would risk falling into your hands.",
  "",
  "INTERROGATOR: One last question, and also the most important: Until now, has Trisolaris sent only radio waves to the Earth?",
  "",
  "YE: Almost true.",
  "",
  "INTERROGATOR: Almost?",
  "",
  "YE: The current Trisolaran civilization is capable of space travel at one-tenth the speed of light.",
  "This technology leap occurred a few decades ago in Earth years.",
  "Before that point, their maximum speed had hovered around one-thousandth the speed of light.",
  "The tiny probes that they sent to the Earth have not even completed one-hundredth of the journey between there and here.",
  "",
  "INTERROGATOR: Then I have a question.",
  "If the Trisolaran Fleet that had been launched is capable of flight at one-tenth the speed of light, it should take only forty years to reach the solar system.",
  "So why do you say that it would take more than four hundred years?",
  "",
  "YE: Here’s the thing.",
  "The Trisolaran Interstellar Fleet is composed of incredibly massive spaceships.",
  "Accelerating them is a slow process.",
  "One-tenth the speed of light is only their maximum speed, but they cannot cruise at this speed for long before decelerating as they approach the Earth.",
  "Also, the source of propulsion for the Trisolaran ships is matter-antimatter annihilation.",
  "In front of each ship is a large magnetic field shaped like a funnel to collect antimatter particles from space.",
  "This collection process is slow, and only after a long wait can it gather enough antimatter to allow the ship to accelerate for a brief period.",
  "Thus, the fleet’s acceleration occurs in spurts, interspersed by long periods of coasting to collect fuel.",
  "This is why the time it takes the Trisolaran Fleet to reach the solar system is ten times longer than the flight time of a small probe.",
  "",
  "INTERROGATOR: Then what did you mean by “almost” just now?",

  "Outside this context, even backward human beings are capable of accelerating certain objects to close to the speed of light.",

  "INTERROGATOR: (a pause) By “context,” do you mean at the macro scale?",
  "At a micro scale, humans can already use high-energy particle accelerators to speed up subatomic particles to near the speed of light.",

  "YE: You’re very clever.",

  "INTERROGATOR: (points to his earpiece) I have the world’s foremost scientists behind me.",

  "Six years ago, in the distant Trisolaran stellar system, Trisolaris accelerated two hydrogen nuclei to near the speed of light and shot them toward the solar system.",

  "YE: (laughs) You also said “almost.”",

  "They can only accelerate something as small as a proton to near the speed of light.",
  "So over a distance of four light-years, they can only send two protons.",
  "",
  "INTERROGATOR: At the macroscopic level, two protons are nothing.",
  "Even a single cilium on a bacterium would include several billion protons.",

  "YE WENJIE: Kalian sudah tahu semua yang saya tahu.",
  "Malah, sekarang ada banyak hal yang ingin saya pelajari dari kalian.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Rasanya Anda belum menceritakan semuanya.",
  "Pertama, kami ingin tahu ini: Di antara pesan-pesan yang dikirim Trisurya ke Bumi, apa isi bagian yang dicegat dan disembunyikan oleh Kaum Adventis?",
  "",
  "YE: Saya tidak bisa memberitahu Anda.",
  "Organisasi mereka sangat ketat.",
  "Saya hanya tahu bahwa mereka memang menyembunyikan beberapa pesan.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Ganti topik.",
  "Setelah Kaum Adventis memonopoli komunikasi dengan Trisurya, apakah Anda membangun Pangkalan Red Coast ketiga?",
  "",
  "YE: Saya memang punya rencana seperti itu.",
  "Tapi kami hanya membangun penerima, lalu pembangunannya berhenti.",
  "Peralatan dan pangkalannya sudah dibongkar semua.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Kenapa?",
  "",
  "YE: Karena tidak ada lagi pesan yang datang dari Alpha Centauri.",
  "Tidak ada apa-apa di frekuensi mana pun.",
  "Saya rasa kalian sudah mengonfirmasi hal ini.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Ya.",
  "Dengan kata lain—setidaknya sejak empat tahun lalu—Trisurya memutuskan untuk memutus semua komunikasi dengan Bumi.",
  "Ini membuat pesan-pesan yang dicegat Kaum Adventis menjadi semakin penting.",
  "",
  "YE: Benar.",
  "Tapi sungguh tidak ada lagi yang bisa saya ceritakan tentang itu.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: (jeda beberapa detik) Kalau begitu, mari kita cari topik lain yang bisa Anda ceritakan lebih banyak.",
  "Mike Evans membohongi Anda, benar begitu?",
  "",
  "YE: Boleh dibilang begitu.",
  "Dia tidak pernah mengungkapkan isi hati terdalamnya kepada saya, dan hanya menunjukkan rasa kewajibannya terhadap spesies lain di planet ini.",
  "Saya tidak pernah menyadari bahwa rasa kewajiban itu telah menyebabkan kebenciannya terhadap peradaban manusia berkembang begitu ekstrem, hingga dia menjadikan pemusnahan umat manusia sebagai cita-cita tertingginya.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Mari kita lihat komposisi ETO saat ini.",
  "Kaum Adventis ingin memusnahkan umat manusia dengan kekuatan asing; Kaum Penebus memuja peradaban asing itu sebagai dewa; Kaum Penyintas ingin mengkhianati sesama manusia demi membeli kelangsungan hidup mereka sendiri.",
  "Tak satu pun dari ini sejalan dengan cita-cita awal Anda untuk menggunakan peradaban asing sebagai cara mereformasi umat manusia.",
  "",
  "YE: Saya yang memantik apinya, tapi saya tak kuasa mengendalikan kobarannya.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Anda punya rencana untuk menyingkirkan Kaum Adventis dari dalam ETO, dan Anda bahkan mulai melaksanakannya.",
  "Tapi Judgment Day adalah pangkalan inti dan pusat komando bagi Kaum Adventis, dan Mike Evans serta para pemimpin Adventis lainnya biasanya tinggal di sana.",
  "Kenapa kalian tidak menyerang kapal itu lebih dulu?",
  "Sebagian besar pasukan bersenjata Kaum Penebus setia kepada Anda, dan Anda seharusnya punya cukup daya tembak untuk menenggelamkan atau merebutnya.",
  "",
  "YE: Itu karena pesan-pesan dari Sang Tuan yang mereka cegat.",
  "Semua pesan itu tersimpan di Pangkalan Red Coast Kedua, di komputer yang ada di Judgment Day.",
  "Jika kami menyerang kapal itu, Kaum Adventis bisa saja menghapus semua pesan itu saat mereka sadar kekalahan sudah di depan mata.",
  "Pesan-pesan itu terlalu penting, kami tak berani mengambil risiko kehilangannya.",
  "Bagi Kaum Penebus, kehilangan pesan-pesan itu ibarat umat Kristen kehilangan Alkitab atau umat Islam kehilangan Al-Qur'an.",
  "Saya rasa kalian menghadapi masalah yang sama.",
  "Kaum Adventis menyandera pesan-pesan Sang Tuan, dan itulah sebabnya Judgment Day tetap tak tersentuh sejauh ini.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Ada saran untuk kami?",
  "",
  "YE: Tidak.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Anda juga menyebut Trisurya sebagai “Tuan” Anda.",
  "Apakah ini berarti Anda juga mengembangkan perasaan religius terhadap Trisurya seperti Kaum Penebus?",
  "Apakah Anda sudah menjadi penganut iman Trisurya?",
  "",
  "YE: Sama sekali tidak.",
  "Itu hanya kebiasaan.",
  "… Saya tidak ingin membahasnya lebih lanjut.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Mari kembali ke pesan-pesan yang dicegat itu.",
  "Mungkin Anda tidak tahu isi persisnya, tapi Anda pasti pernah mendengar desas-desus tentang beberapa detailnya?",
  "",
  "YE: Mungkin hanya rumor tak berdasar.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Seperti apa?",
  "",
  "YE: …",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Apakah Trisurya mentransfer teknologi tertentu kepada Kaum Adventis, teknologi yang lebih maju daripada teknologi manusia saat ini?",
  "",
  "YE: Sepertinya tidak.",
  "Karena teknologi semacam itu berisiko jatuh ke tangan kalian.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Satu pertanyaan terakhir, dan juga yang paling penting: Sampai sekarang, apakah Trisurya hanya mengirim gelombang radio ke Bumi?",
  "",
  "YE: Hampir benar.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Hampir?",
  "",
  "YE: Peradaban Trisurya saat ini mampu melakukan perjalanan antariksa dengan sepersepuluh kecepatan cahaya.",
  "Lompatan teknologi ini terjadi beberapa dekade lalu dalam hitungan tahun Bumi.",
  "Sebelum titik itu, kecepatan maksimum mereka berkisar di seperseribu kecepatan cahaya.",
  "Wahana-wahana kecil yang mereka kirim ke Bumi bahkan belum menempuh seperseratus perjalanan dari sana ke sini.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Kalau begitu saya punya pertanyaan.",
  "Jika Armada Trisurya yang telah diluncurkan mampu terbang dengan sepersepuluh kecepatan cahaya, seharusnya hanya butuh empat puluh tahun untuk mencapai tata surya.",
  "Jadi kenapa Anda bilang butuh lebih dari empat ratus tahun?",
  "",
  "YE: Begini masalahnya.",
  "Armada Antarbintang Trisurya terdiri dari kapal-kapal antariksa yang sangat masif.",
  "Mempercepat kapal-kapal itu adalah proses yang lambat.",
  "Sepersepuluh kecepatan cahaya hanyalah kecepatan maksimum mereka, tapi mereka tidak bisa melaju dengan kecepatan ini dalam waktu lama sebelum harus melambat saat mendekati Bumi.",
  "Selain itu, sumber tenaga pendorong kapal-kapal Trisurya adalah anihilasi materi-antimateri.",
  "Di depan setiap kapal ada medan magnet besar berbentuk corong untuk mengumpulkan partikel antimateri dari angkasa.",
  "Proses pengumpulan ini lambat, dan hanya setelah penantian panjang mereka bisa mengumpulkan cukup antimateri agar kapal bisa berakselerasi dalam waktu singkat.",
  "Jadi, akselerasi armada terjadi secara bertahap, diselingi periode meluncur yang lama untuk mengumpulkan bahan bakar.",
  "Inilah sebabnya waktu yang dibutuhkan Armada Trisurya untuk mencapai tata surya sepuluh kali lebih lama daripada waktu tempuh wahana kecil.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Lalu apa maksud kata “hampir” tadi?",
  "",
  "YE: Kita bicara soal kecepatan penerbangan antariksa dalam konteks tertentu.",
  "Di luar konteks ini, manusia yang terbelakang pun mampu mempercepat objek tertentu hingga mendekati kecepatan cahaya.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: (jeda) Yang Anda maksud dengan “konteks”, apakah skala makro?",
  "Pada skala mikro, manusia sudah bisa menggunakan akselerator partikel berenergi tinggi untuk mempercepat partikel subatom hingga mendekati kecepatan cahaya.",
  "Partikel-partikel inilah “objek” yang Anda maksud, benar?",
  "",
  "YE: Anda sangat cerdas.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: (menunjuk alat di telinganya) Saya didukung oleh ilmuwan-ilmuwan terkemuka di dunia.",
  "",
  "YE: Ya, maksud saya partikel subatom.",
  "Enam tahun lalu, di sistem bintang Trisurya yang jauh, Trisurya mempercepat dua inti hidrogen hingga mendekati kecepatan cahaya dan menembakkannya ke arah tata surya.",
  "Dua inti hidrogen ini, atau proton, tiba di tata surya dua tahun lalu, lalu mencapai Bumi.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Dua proton?",
  "Mereka hanya mengirim dua proton?",
  "Itu hampir tidak ada artinya.",
  "",
  "YE: (tertawa) Anda juga bilang “hampir”.",
  "Itulah batas kekuatan Trisurya.",
  "Mereka hanya bisa mempercepat sesuatu sekecil proton hingga mendekati kecepatan cahaya.",
  "Jadi dalam jarak empat tahun cahaya, mereka hanya bisa mengirim dua proton.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Di tingkat makroskopis, dua proton itu bukan apa-apa.",
  "Satu silia pada bakteri saja mengandung beberapa miliar proton.",
  "Apa gunanya?",
  "",
  "YE: Itu adalah sebuah kunci.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Kunci?",
  "Apa yang mereka kunci?",
  "",
  "YE: Mereka menyegel kemajuan sains manusia.",
  "Karena keberadaan dua proton ini, umat manusia tidak akan mampu membuat perkembangan ilmiah penting apa pun selama empat setengah abad sampai kedatangan Armada Trisurya.",
  "Evans pernah bilang bahwa hari kedatangan dua proton itu juga merupakan hari matinya sains manusia.",
  "",
  "INTEROGATOR: Itu… terlalu fantastis.",
  "Bagaimana mungkin?",

  "“Aku hanya ingin menunjukkan fakta ini: Di alam semesta, tanda penting kemajuan teknologi suatu peradaban adalah kemampuannya mengendalikan dan memanfaatkan dimensi mikro.",
  "Memanfaatkan partikel dasar tanpa mengambil keuntungan dari dimensi mikro adalah sesuatu yang sudah mulai dilakukan nenek moyang kita yang telanjang dan berbulu saat mereka menyalakan api unggun di dalam gua.",
  "Mengendalikan reaksi kimia hanyalah memanipulasi partikel mikro tanpa mempedulikan dimensi mikro.",
  "Tentu saja, pengendalian ini juga berkembang dari kasar menjadi canggih: dari api unggun ke mesin uap, lalu generator.",

  "Dari sudut pandang peradaban yang lebih maju di alam semesta, api unggun, komputer, dan nanomaterial tidak berbeda secara mendasar.",

  "For now, our opponents are still human.",

  "This is a great opportunity for us.",
  "As the situation develops, such an opportunity may never arise again.",
  "Right now, all the Battle Command Centers around the globe are drafting up operation plans, and Central will select one within ten hours and begin implementation.",

  "But if they just emptied a cartridge clip at the server hard drive or other storage media, it would all be over, and doing so would take no more than ten seconds.",
  "So we must disable all enemies near the storage equipment within ten seconds of their detecting an attack.",

  "Da Shi returned, grinning at everyone.",
  "He picked up the cigars on the table.",
  "The one that had been lit he put into his mouth, and the other he stuffed into his pocket.",
  "",
  "Someone asked, “When Judgment Day passes, can those two pillars bear the force applied against the Flying Blade filaments?",
  "Maybe the pillars would be sliced apart first.”",
  "",
  "Wang said, “That’s easy to solve.",
  "We have some small amounts of Flying Blade material that are flat sheets.",
  "We can use them to protect the parts of the column where the filaments are attached.”",
  "",
  "The discussion after that was mainly between the naval officers and navigation experts.",
  "",
  "“Judgment Day is at the upper limit in terms of tonnage that can pass through the Panama Canal.",
  "It has a deep draft, so we have to consider installing filaments below the waterline.”",
  "",
  "“That will be very difficult.",
  "If there’s not enough time, I don’t think we should worry about it.",
  "The parts of the ship below the waterline are used for engines, fuel, and ballast, causing a lot of noise, vibration, and interference.",
  "The conditions are too poor for computing centers and other similar facilities to be located there.",
  "But for the parts above water, a tighter nanofilament net will give better results.”",
  "",
  "“Then it’s best to set the trap at one of the locks along the canal.",
  "Judgment Day is built to Panamax specifications, just enough to fill the thirty-two-meter locks.",
  "Then we would only need to make the Flying Blade filaments thirty-two meters long.",
  "This will also make it easier to erect the pillars and string the filaments between them, especially for the underwater parts.”",
  "",
  "“No.",
  "The situation around the locks is too unpredictable.",
  "Also, a ship inside the lock must be pulled forward by four ‘mules,’ electric locomotives on rails.",
  "They move slowly, and the time inside the locks will also be when the crew is most alert.",
  "An attempt to slice through the ship during that time would most likely be discovered.”",
  "",
  "“What about the Bridge of the Americas, right outside the Miraflores Locks?",
  "The abutments at the two ends of the bridge can serve as the pillars for stringing the filaments.”",
  "",
  "“No.",
  "The distance between the abutments is too great.",
  "We don’t have enough Flying Blade material.”",
  "",
  "“Then it’s decided: The site of operation should be the narrowest point of the Gaillard Cut, a hundred and fifty meters across.",
  "Add in some slack for the pillars … let’s call it a hundred seventy meters.”",
  "",
  "Wang said, “If that’s the plan, then the smallest distance between the filaments will be fifty centimeters.",
  "I don’t have enough material for a tighter net.”",
  "",
  "“In other words, we have to make sure the ship crosses during the day,” Da Shi said, blowing out another mouthful of smoke.",
  "",
  "“Why?”",
  "",
  "“At night the crew will be sleeping, which means they’ll all be lying down.",
  "Fifty centimeters between filaments leaves too much of a gap.",
  "But during the day, even if they’re sitting or crouching, the distance is sufficient.”",

  "A few scattered laughs.",
  "The attendees, all under heavy stress, felt a bit of release tinged with the smell of blood.",

  "“You’re truly a demon,” a female UN official said to Da Shi.",

  "Wang asked, his voice trembling.",
  "",
  "A naval officer replied, “When the ship goes through the locks, more than a dozen cable workers will come onboard, but they’ll all get off after the ship passes.",
  "The Panama Canal pilot will have to accompany the ship the entire eighty-two kilometers, so the pilot will have to be sacrificed.”",
  "",
  "A CIA officer said, “And some of the crew aboard Judgment Day probably don’t know the real purpose of the ship.”",

  "“Professor,” General Chang said, “do not concern yourself with these thoughts.",

  "But he had had no chance to see either of them.",
  "",
  "Two days earlier, he had arrived by direct flight from China to Tocumen International Airport near Panama City and then rode a helicopter here.",
  "The sight before him was very common: The construction work under way to widen the canal caused the tropical forest on both slopes to be quite sparse, revealing large patches of yellow earth.",
  "The color felt familiar to Wang.",
  "The canal didn’t seem very special, probably because it was so narrow here, but a hundred thousand people had dug out this part of the canal in the previous century, one hoe at a time.",

  "Wang and Colonel Stanton sat on lounge chairs under an awning halfway up the slope.",
  "Both wore loose, colorful shirts, with their Panama hats tossed to the side, looking like two tourists.",
  "",
  "Below, on each shore of the canal, a twenty-four-meter steel pillar lay flat against the ground, parallel to the shore.",
  "Fifty ultrastrong nanofilaments, each 160 meters long, were strung between the pillars.",
  "At the end on the eastern shore, every filament was connected to a length of regular steel wire.",
  "This was to give the filaments enough slack so that they could sink to the bottom of the canal, aided by attached weights.",
  "The setup permitted other ships safe passage.",
  "Luckily, traffic along the canal wasn’t quite as busy as Wang had imagined.",
  "On average, only about forty large ships passed through each day.",
  "",
  "The operation’s code name was “Guzheng,” based on the similarity between the structure and the ancient Chinese zither by that name.",

  "He continued the conversation with Wang.",
  "“The second time I came to Panama was in 1999, to attend the ceremony for the handover of the canal to Panama.",
  "Oddly, by the time we got to the Authority’s building, the Stars and Stripes were already gone.",
  "Supposedly the U.S. government had requested that the flag be lowered a day early to avoid the embarrassment of lowering the flag in front of a crowd.",

  "By now the sun that had risen over the Atlantic was falling toward the Pacific.",
  "The canal sparkled with golden light.",
  "Close by, the deadly zither stood quietly.",
  "The two steel pillars were dark and reflected no sunlight, looking even older than the canal that flowed between them.",

  "“Target is two kilometers from the zither.”",

  "I don’t remember the details of the wars I experienced.",
  "Like I just said, those wars all seem so insignificant.",

  "“Ah, no…” Wang answered perfunctorily, his mind elsewhere.",
  "",
  "“Target is one point five kilometers from the zither.”",
  "",
  "“Professor, I think you will be the Gaillard of this new era.",
  "We’re waiting for your new Panama Canal to be built.",
  "Indeed, the space elevator is a canal.",
  "Just as the Panama Canal connected two oceans, the space elevator will connect space with the Earth.”",

  "He was grateful, but it wasn’t working.",
  "",
  "“Target is one kilometer from the zither.”",
  "",
  "Judgment Day appeared.",
  "In the light from the setting sun coming over the hills to the side, it was a dark silhouette against the golden waves of the canal.",
  "The sixty-thousand-ton ship was much larger than Wang had imagined.",
  "Its appearance was like another peak abruptly inserted among the hills.",
  "Even though Wang knew that the canal was capable of accommodating ships as large as seventy thousand tons, witnessing such a large ship in such a narrow waterway was a strange feeling.",
  "Given its immensity, the canal below seemed to no longer exist.",
  "The ship was a mountain gliding across solid earth.",
  "After he grew used to the sunlight, Wang saw that Judgment Day’s hull was pitch black, and the superstructure was painted pure white.",
  "The giant antenna was gone.",
  "They heard the roar from the ship’s engines, accompanied by the churning sound of waves that had been generated by the round prow slapping against the shores of the canal.",
  "",
  "As the distance between Judgment Day and the deadly zither closed, Wang’s heart began to beat faster, and his breath became short.",
  "He had a desire to run away, but he felt so weak that he could no longer control his body.",
  "All at once, he was overwhelmed by a deep hatred for Shi Qiang.",
  "How could the bastard have come up with such an idea?",
  "Like that UN official said, he is a demon!",
  "But the feeling passed.",
  "He thought that if Da Shi were by his side, he would probably feel better.",
  "Colonel Stanton had invited Shi Qiang to come, but General Chang refused to give permission because he said that Da Shi was needed where he was.",
  "Wang felt the colonel’s hand on his back.",
  "",
  "“Professor, all this will pass.”",
  "",
  "Judgment Day was below them now, passing through the deadly zither.",
  "When its prow first contacted the plane between the two steel pillars, the space that seemed empty, Wang’s scalp tightened.",
  "But nothing happened.",
  "The immense hull of the ship continued to slowly sail past the two steel pillars.",
  "When half the ship had passed, Wang began to doubt whether the nanofilaments between the steel pillars really existed.",
  "",
  "But a small sign soon negated his doubt.",
  "He noticed a thin antenna located at the very top of the superstructure breaking at its base, and the antenna tumbling down.",
  "",
  "Soon, there was a second sign indicating the presence of the nanofilaments, a sign that almost made Wang break down.",
  "Judgment Day’s wide deck was empty save for one man standing near the stern hosing down the ship’s bollards.",
  "From his vantage point, Wang saw everything clearly.",
  "The moment that that section of the ship passed between the pillars, the hose broke into two pieces not too far from the man, and water spilled out.",
  "The man’s body stiffened, and the nozzle tumbled from his hand.",
  "He remained standing for a few seconds, then fell.",
  "As his body contacted the deck, it came apart in two halves.",
  "The top half crawled through the expanding pool of blood, but had to use two arms that were bloody stumps.",
  "The hands had been cleanly sliced off.",
  "",
  "After the stern of the ship went between the two pillars, Judgment Day continued to sail forward at the same speed, and everything seemed normal.",
  "But then Wang heard the sound of the engine shift into a strange whine, before turning into chaotic noise.",
  "It sounded like a wrench being thrown into the rotor of a large motor—no, many, many wrenches.",
  "He knew this was the result of the rotating parts of the engine having been cut.",
  "After a piercing, tearing sound, a hole appeared in the side of the stern of Judgment Day, made by a large metallic piece punching through the hull.",
  "A broken component flew out of the hole and fell into the water, causing a large column of water to shoot up.",
  "As it briefly flew past, Wang recognized it as a section of the engine crankshaft.",
  "",
  "A thick column of smoke poured out of the hole.",
  "Judgment Day, which had been sailing along the right shore, now began to turn, dragging this smoky tail.",
  "Soon it crossed over the canal and smashed into the left shore.",
  "As Wang looked, the giant prow deformed as it collided into the slope, slicing open the hill like water, causing waves of earth to spill in all directions.",
  "At the same time, Judgment Day began to separate into more than forty slices, each slice half a meter thick.",
  "The slices near the top moved faster than the slices near the bottom, and the ship spread open like a deck of cards.",
  "As the forty-some metal slices moved past each other, the piercing noise was like countless giant fingernails scratching against glass.",
  "",
  "By the time the intolerable noise ended, Judgment Day was spilled on the shore like a stack of plates carried by a stumbling waiter, the plates near the top having traveled the farthest.",
  "The slices looked as soft as cloth, and rapidly deformed into complicated shapes impossible to imagine as having once belonged to a ship.",
  "",
  "Soldiers rushed toward the shore from the slope.",
  "Wang was surprised to find so many men hidden nearby.",
  "A fleet of helicopters arrived along the canal with their engines roaring; crossed the canal surface, which was now covered by an iridescent oil slick; hovered over the wreckage of Judgment Day; and began to drop large quantities of fire suppression foam and powder.",
  "Shortly, the fire in the wreckage was under control, and three other helicopters began to drop searchers into the wreckage with cables.",
  "",
  "Colonel Stanton had already left.",
  "Wang picked up the binoculars he’d left on top of his hat.",
  "Overcoming his trembling hands, he observed Judgment Day.",
  "By this time, the wreckage was mostly covered by fire-extinguishing foam and powder, but the edges of some of the slices were left exposed.",
  "Wang saw the cut surfaces, smooth as mirrors.",
  "They reflected the fiery red light of dusk perfectly.",
  "He also saw a deep red spot on the mirror surface.",
  "He wasn’t sure if it was blood.",

  "Wang mengangguk.",
  "“Mengingat teknik konstruksi molekuler kami saat ini, satu-satunya bentuk yang bisa kami buat adalah filamen.",
  "Ketebalannya sekitar seperseratus ketebalan rambut manusia.",

  "“Kalau begitu yang terbaik adalah memasang jebakan di salah satu pintu air di sepanjang terusan.",
  "Judgment Day dibangun dengan spesifikasi Panamax, pas sekali untuk mengisi pintu air tiga puluh dua meter.",
  "Maka kita hanya perlu membuat filamen Pisau Terbang sepanjang tiga puluh dua meter.",
  "Ini juga akan mempermudah pendirian pilar dan pembentangan filamen di antaranya, terutama untuk bagian bawah air.”",
  "",
  "“Tidak.",
  "Situasi di sekitar pintu air terlalu tidak terduga.",
  "Selain itu, kapal di dalam pintu air harus ditarik maju oleh empat ‘keledai’, lokomotif listrik di atas rel.",

  "Judgment Day muncul.",
  "Dalam cahaya matahari terbenam yang datang dari balik bukit di samping, kapal itu menjadi siluet gelap di atas gelombang emas terusan.",
  "Kapal seberat enam puluh ribu ton itu jauh lebih besar daripada yang dibayangkan Wang.",
  "Kemunculannya seperti puncak lain yang tiba-tiba menyisip di antara bukit-bukit.",
  "Meskipun Wang tahu bahwa terusan itu mampu menampung kapal sebesar tujuh puluh ribu ton, menyaksikan kapal sebesar itu di jalur air yang begitu sempit adalah perasaan yang aneh.",
  "Mengingat ukurannya yang sangat besar, terusan di bawahnya seolah tidak ada lagi.",
  "Kapal itu adalah gunung yang meluncur di atas tanah padat.",
  "Setelah terbiasa dengan sinar matahari, Wang melihat bahwa lambung Judgment Day berwarna hitam pekat, dan struktur atasnya dicat putih bersih.",
  "Antena raksasanya sudah tidak ada.",
  "Mereka mendengar deru mesin kapal, disertai suara deburan ombak yang dihasilkan oleh haluan bulat yang menampar tepian terusan.",

  "Saat jarak antara Judgment Day dan kecapi maut semakin dekat, jantung Wang mulai berdetak lebih cepat, dan napasnya menjadi pendek.",
  "Dia punya keinginan untuk lari, tapi dia merasa begitu lemah hingga tidak bisa lagi mengendalikan tubuhnya.",

  "Bagaimana bajingan itu bisa punya ide seperti ini?",
  "Seperti kata pejabat PBB itu, dia adalah iblis!",

  "Judgment Day kini berada di bawah mereka, melewati kecapi maut.",
  "Ketika haluannya pertama kali menyentuh bidang di antara kedua pilar baja, ruang yang tampak kosong itu, kulit kepala Wang menegang.",
  "Tapi tidak terjadi apa-apa.",
  "Lambung kapal yang sangat besar itu terus berlayar perlahan melewati kedua pilar baja.",
  "Ketika separuh kapal sudah lewat, Wang mulai ragu apakah nanofilamen di antara pilar baja itu benar-benar ada.",
  "",
  "Namun sebuah tanda kecil segera menepis keraguannya.",
  "Dia melihat antena tipis yang terletak di puncak paling atas struktur bangunan kapal patah di pangkalnya, dan antena itu pun jatuh terguling.",
  "",
  "Segera, ada tanda kedua yang menunjukkan keberadaan nanofilamen, tanda yang hampir membuat Wang hancur lebur.",
  "Dek Judgment Day yang luas itu kosong kecuali satu orang yang berdiri di dekat buritan sedang menyemprot tonggak penambat kapal.",
  "Dari tempat pengamatannya, Wang melihat semuanya dengan jelas.",
  "Saat bagian kapal itu melewati pilar, selang itu putus menjadi dua bagian tidak jauh dari orang itu, dan air tumpah keluar.",
  "Tubuh pria itu menegang, dan nosel terlepas dari tangannya.",
  "Dia tetap berdiri selama beberapa detik, lalu jatuh.",
  "Saat tubuhnya menyentuh dek, tubuh itu terbelah menjadi dua bagian.",
  "Bagian atasnya merangkak melalui genangan darah yang meluas, tetapi harus menggunakan dua lengan yang berupa puntung berdarah.",
  "Tangan-tangannya telah teriris putus dengan rapi.",
  "",
  "Setelah buritan kapal melewati kedua pilar, Judgment Day terus berlayar maju dengan kecepatan yang sama, dan semuanya tampak normal.",
  "Tapi kemudian Wang mendengar suara mesin berubah menjadi dengungan aneh, sebelum berubah menjadi suara kacau balau.",
  "Terdengar seperti kunci inggris yang dilemparkan ke rotor motor besar—bukan, banyak, banyak sekali kunci inggris.",
  "Dia tahu ini adalah akibat dari bagian-bagian mesin yang berputar telah terpotong.",
  "Setelah suara sobekan yang memilukan, sebuah lubang muncul di sisi buritan Judgment Day, dibuat oleh potongan logam besar yang meninju lambung kapal.",
  "Sebuah komponen yang rusak terbang keluar dari lubang dan jatuh ke air, menyebabkan kolom air besar menyembur ke atas.",
  "Saat komponen itu melintas sekejap, Wang mengenalinya sebagai bagian dari poros engkol mesin.",
  "",
  "Kolom asap tebal mengepul keluar dari lubang itu.",
  "Judgment Day, yang tadinya berlayar di sepanjang pantai kanan, kini mulai berbelok, menyeret ekor berasap ini.",
  "Segera kapal itu menyeberangi terusan dan menghantam pantai kiri.",
  "Saat Wang melihat, haluan raksasa itu berubah bentuk saat menabrak lereng, mengiris bukit seperti air, menyebabkan gelombang tanah tumpah ke segala arah.",
  "Pada saat yang sama, Judgment Day mulai terpisah menjadi lebih dari empat puluh irisan, setiap irisan setebal setengah meter.",
  "Irisan di dekat bagian atas bergerak lebih cepat daripada irisan di dekat bagian bawah, dan kapal itu menyebar terbuka seperti tumpukan kartu.",
  "Saat empat puluh lebih irisan logam itu bergerak melewati satu sama lain, suara melengkingnya terdengar seperti kuku raksasa tak terhitung jumlahnya yang menggaruk kaca.",
  "",
  "Pada saat suara yang tak tertahankan itu berakhir, Judgment Day tumpah di pantai seperti tumpukan piring yang dibawa oleh pelayan yang tersandung, piring-piring di dekat bagian atas terlempar paling jauh.",
  "Irisan-irisan itu tampak selembut kain, dan dengan cepat berubah bentuk menjadi bentuk-bentuk rumit yang mustahil dibayangkan pernah menjadi bagian dari sebuah kapal.",
  "",
  "Para tentara bergegas menuju pantai dari lereng.",
  "Wang terkejut menemukan begitu banyak orang bersembunyi di dekat situ.",
  "Armada helikopter tiba di sepanjang terusan dengan mesin menderu; melintasi permukaan terusan, yang kini tertutup lapisan minyak yang berkilau; melayang di atas puing-puing Judgment Day; dan mulai menjatuhkan busa dan bubuk pemadam api dalam jumlah besar.",
  "Tak lama kemudian, api di puing-puing itu dapat dikendalikan, dan tiga helikopter lain mulai menurunkan tim pencari ke dalam puing-puing dengan kabel.",
  "",
  "Kolonel Stanton sudah pergi.",
  "Wang mengambil teropong yang ditinggalkannya di atas topinya.",
  "Mengatasi tangannya yang gemetar, dia mengamati Judgment Day.",
  "Pada saat ini, puing-puing itu sebagian besar tertutup oleh busa dan bubuk pemadam api, tetapi tepi beberapa irisan masih terekspos.",
  "Wang melihat permukaan potongannya, halus bagaikan cermin.",
  "Permukaan itu memantulkan cahaya merah menyala dari senja dengan sempurna.",

  "",
  "Listening Post 1379 had already been in existence for more than a thousand years.",
  "There were several thousand posts like it on Trisolaris, all of them dedicating their efforts to detecting possible signs of intelligent life in the universe.",
  "",
  "Initially, each listening post had several hundred listeners, but as technology advanced, there was only one person on duty.",
  "Being a listener was a humble career.",
  "Though they lived in listening posts that were kept at a constant temperature, with support systems that guaranteed their survival without requiring them to dehydrate during Chaotic Eras, they also had to live their lives within the narrow confines of these tiny spaces.",
  "The amount of joy they got from Stable Eras was far less than others got.",
  "",
  "The listener at Post 1379 looked through the tiny window at the world of Trisolaris outside.",
  "This was a Chaotic Era night.",
  "The giant moon had not yet risen, and most people remained in dehydrated hibernation.",
  "Even plants had instinctively dehydrated and turned into lifeless bundles of dry fiber lying against the ground.",
  "Under the starlight, the ground looked like a giant sheet of cold metal.",
  "",
  "This was the loneliest time.",
  "In the deep silence of midnight, the universe revealed itself to its listeners as a vast desolation.",
  "What the listener of Post 1379 disliked the most was seeing the waves that slowly crawled across the display, a visual record of the meaningless noise the listening post picked up from space.",
  "He felt this interminable wave was an abstract view of the universe: one end connected to the endless past, the other to the endless future, and in the middle only the ups and downs of random chance—without life, without pattern, the peaks and valleys at different heights like uneven grains of sand, the whole curve like a one-dimensional desert made of all the grains of sand lined up in a row: lonely, desolate, so long that it was intolerable.",
  "You could follow it and go forward or backward as long as you liked, but you’d never find the end.",
  "",
  "On this day, however, the listener saw something odd when he glanced at the waveform display.",
  "Even experts had a hard time telling with the naked eye whether a waveform carried information.",
  "But the listener was so familiar with the noise of the universe that he could tell that the wave that now moved in front of his eyes had something extra.",
  "The thin curve, rising and falling, seemed to possess a soul.",
  "He was certain that the radio signal before him had been modulated by intelligence.",
  "",
  "He rushed in front of another terminal and checked the computer’s rating of the signal’s recognizability: a Red 10.",
  "Before this, no radio signal received by the listening post had ever garnered a recognizability rating above a Blue 2.",
  "A Red rating meant the likelihood that the transmission contained intelligent information was greater than 90 percent.",
  "A rating of Red 10 meant the received transmission contained a self-interpreting coding system!",
  "The deciphering computer worked at full power.",
  "",
  "Still caught up by the dizzying excitement and confusion, the listener stared at the waveform display.",
  "Information continued to stream from the universe into the antenna.",
  "Because of the self-interpreting code, the computer was able to perform real-time translation, and the message began to show up immediately.",
  "",
  "The listener opened the resulting document, and, for the first time, a Trisolaran read a message from another world.",

  "The transmission from the solar system ended.",
  "The deciphering computer now ran uselessly.",
  "The post was once again only hearing the noise of the universe.",

  "He knew as well that the several thousand listening posts spread across Trisolaris had also received this message, which Trisolaran civilization had awaited for eons.",
  "Two hundred cycles of civilization had been crawling through a dark tunnel, and there was finally a glimmer of light before them.",

  "What a beautiful world!",
  "The paradise we imagined really exists!",
  "",
  "The thrill and excitement cooled, and all that remained was a sense of loss and desolation.",
  "During the long loneliness of the past, the listener had asked himself more than once: Even if one day a message from an extra-Trisolaran civilization were to arrive, what would that have to do with me?",
  "His own lonely and humble life would not change one iota because of it.",

  "By now, he had lived six hundred thousand Trisolaran hours.",
  "The life expectancy of Trisolarans ranged between seven hundred to eight hundred thousand Trisolaran hours.",

  "It was inaccurate to say that the receipt of the extra-Trisolaran message had no influence on his life.",
  "After confirmation, Trisolaris would surely reduce the number of listening posts.",
  "And posts like this one, behind the times, would be among the first to be cut.",
  "Then he would be unemployed.",
  "A listener’s skills were very specialized, consisting only of some routine operations and maintenance.",
  "It would be very difficult to find another job.",
  "If he couldn’t find another job within five thousand Trisolaran hours, he would be forcibly dehydrated and then burnt.",

  "The only way to escape this fate was to mate with a member of the opposite sex.",
  "When that happened, the organic material making up their bodies would meld into one.",
  "Two-thirds of the material would then become fuel to power the biochemical reaction that would completely renew the cells in the remaining one-third and create a new body.",
  "Then this body would divide into three to five tiny new lives: their children.",
  "They would inherit some of the memories of their parents, continue their lives, and begin the cycle of life anew.",

  "The princeps had ordered an emergency meeting of all Trisolaran consuls.",
  "This was very unusual.",
  "Something important must have happened.",
  "",
  "Twenty thousand Trisolaran hours ago, the Trisolaran Fleet had launched.",
  "The ships knew the approximate direction of their target but not its distance.",
  "It was possible that the target was millions of light-hours away, or even at the other end of the galaxy.",
  "Faced with the endless sea of stars, the expedition had little hope.",
  "",
  "The meeting of consuls occurred under the Pendulum Monument.",
  "[As Wang Miao read about this episode, he couldn’t help but recall the session at the UN Building in the Three Body game.",
  "In reality, the Pendulum Monument was one of the few objects in the game that really did exist on Trisolaris.]",
  "",
  "The princeps’s choice of meeting site confused most of the attendees.",
  "The Chaotic Era wasn’t over yet, and a small sun had just risen over the horizon, though it could also set at any moment.",
  "The temperature was cold, and all the attendees were forced to wear fully enclosed electric-heating suits.",
  "The massive metal pendulum swung magnificently, pounding the frigid air.",
  "The small sun cast a long shadow against the ground, as if a giant whose head touched the sky were striding there.",
  "Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, the princeps ascended onto the base of the pendulum and flipped a red switch.",
  "",
  "He turned to the consuls and said, “I have just shut off power to the pendulum.",
  "It will gradually stop under the influence of air resistance.”",
  "",
  "“Princeps, why?”",
  "a consul asked.",
  "",
  "“We all understand the historical significance of the pendulum.",
  "It’s intended to hypnotize God.",
  "But now we know it’s better for Trisolaran civilization to have God awake, because God is now blessing us.”",
  "",
  "Everyone was silent, pondering the meaning of the princeps’s words.",
  "After three more swings from the pendulum, someone asked, “Has the Earth responded?”",
  "",
  "The princeps nodded.",
  "“Yes.",
  "Half an hour ago I received the report.",
  "It was a response to the warning that was sent.”",
  "",
  "“So soon!",
  "Only eighty thousand hours have passed since then, which means … which means…”",
  "",
  "“Which means that the Earth is only forty thousand light-hours from us.”",
  "",
  "“Isn’t that the closest star from here?”",
  "",
  "“Yes.",
  "That is why I said God is blessing Trisolaran civilization.”",
  "",
  "The attendees grew ecstatic, but they couldn’t express the feeling, so the crowd seemed like a pent-up volcano.",
  "The princeps knew that allowing such weak emotions to explode would be dangerous.",
  "So he poured cold water on their sentiments.",
  "",
  "“I have already ordered the Trisolaran Fleet to turn toward this star.",
  "But things are not quite as optimistic as you think.",
  "Given what we know, right now the fleet is sailing toward certain death.”",
  "",
  "The consuls calmed down.",
  "",
  "“Does anyone understand my conclusion?”",
  "",
  "“I do,” said the science consul.",
  "“We’ve all studied the first messages from Earth carefully.",
  "The section most worthy of attention is their history.",
  "Let’s observe the facts: Humans took more than a hundred thousand Earth years to progress from the Hunter-Gatherer Age to the Agricultural Age.",
  "To get from the Agricultural Age to the Industrial Age took a few thousand Earth years.",
  "But to go from the Industrial Age to the Atomic Age took only two hundred Earth years.",
  "Thereafter, in only a few Earth decades, they entered the Information Age.",
  "This civilization possesses the terrifying ability to accelerate their progress.",
  "",
  "“On Trisolaris, of the more than two hundred civilizations, including our own, none has ever experienced such accelerating development.",
  "The progress of science and technology in all Trisolaran civilizations has been at a constant or decelerating pace.",
  "In our world, each technology age requires approximately the same amount of time for steady, slow development.”",
  "",
  "The princeps nodded.",
  "“The fact is that four million and five hundred thousand hours from now, when the Trisolaran Fleet has reached the Earth, that civilization’s technology level will have long surpassed ours, due to their accelerating development.",
  "The journey of the Trisolaran Fleet is long and arduous, and the fleet must pass through two interstellar dust belts.",
  "It’s very likely that only half of the ships will reach the Earth’s solar system, while the rest perish along the way.",
  "And then, the Trisolaran Fleet will be at the mercy of a much more powerful Earth civilization.",
  "This is not an expedition, but a funeral procession!”",
  "",
  "“But if this is true, Princeps, then there are even more frightening consequences…” the military consul said.",
  "",
  "“Yes.",
  "It’s easy to imagine.",
  "The location of Trisolaris has been exposed.",
  "To eliminate future threats, an interstellar fleet from Earth will launch a counterattack against us.",
  "It’s very possible that long before an expanded sun swallows this planet, Trisolaran civilization will have already been extinguished by humans.”",
  "",
  "The bright future had suddenly turned impossibly grim.",
  "The attendees fell silent.",
  "",
  "The princeps said, “What we must do next is contain the progress of science on Earth.",
  "Luckily, as soon as we received the first messages from Earth, we began to develop plans to do so.",
  "As of now, we’ve discovered a favorable condition for realizing these plans: The response we just received was sent by an Earth traitor.",
  "Thus, we have reason to believe that there are many alienated forces within Earth civilization, and we must exploit such forces to the fullest.”",
  "",
  "“Princeps, that is not at all easy.",
  "We have but a thin thread of communication with the Earth.",
  "It takes more than eighty thousand hours to complete an exchange.”",
  "",
  "“But remember that, like us, the knowledge that there are extraterrestrial civilizations will shock all of Earth society and leave profound marks.",
  "We have reason to believe that the alienated forces within Earth civilization will coalesce and grow.”",
  "",
  "“What can they do?",
  "Sabotage?”",
  "",
  "“Given a time gap of forty thousand hours, the strategic value of any traditional tactics of war or terror is insignificant, and they can recover from them.",
  "To effectively contain a civilization’s development and disarm it across such a long span of time, there is only one way: kill its science.”",
  "",
  "The science consul said, “The plan focuses on emphasizing the negative environmental effects of scientific development and showing signs of supernatural power to the population of Earth.",
  "In addition to highlighting the negative effects of progress, we’ll also attempt to use a series of ‘miracles’ to construct an illusory universe that cannot be explained by the logic of science.",
  "After these illusions have been maintained for some time, it’s possible that Trisolaran civilization may become a target of religious worship there.",
  "Then, unscientific ways of thinking will dominate scientific thinking among human intellectuals, and lead to the collapse of the entire scientific system of thought.”",
  "",
  "“How do we create miracles?”",
  "",
  "“The key to miracles is that they cannot be seen as tricks.",
  "This may require that we transfer certain technologies far above current human technology level to the alienated forces on Earth.”",
  "",
  "“That’s too risky!",
  "Who knows who will ultimately control such technologies?",
  "That’s playing with fire.”",
  "",
  "“Of course, which specific technologies should be transferred to produce miracles requires further study.",
  "…”",
  "",
  "“Please hold on for a moment, Science Consul,” said the military consul as he stood up.",
  "“Princeps, I am of the opinion that this plan will be almost useless in terms of stopping human science.”",
  "",
  "“But it’s better than nothing,” the science consul argued.",
  "",
  "“Barely,” the military consul said contemptuously.",
  "",
  "“I agree with your view,” the princeps said.",
  "“This plan will only interfere slightly with human scientific development.",
  "We need a decisive act that will completely suffocate science on Earth and freeze it at its current level.",
  "Let’s focus on the key here: Overall technological development depends on the advancement of basic science, and the foundation of basic science lies in the exploration of the deep structure of matter.",
  "If there’s no progress in this field, there can be no major breakthrough in science and technology as a whole.",
  "Of course, this is not specific to civilization on Earth.",
  "It is applicable to all targets that Trisolaran civilization intends to conquer.",
  "We had begun work in this area even before receiving the first extra-Trisolaran communication.",
  "But we’ve recently stepped up the effort.",
  "",
  "“Now, everyone, look up.",
  "What’s that?”",
  "",
  "The princeps pointed at the sky.",
  "The consuls lifted their heads to gaze in that direction.",
  "They saw a ring in space giving off a metallic glow in the sunlight.",
  "",
  "“Is that the dock for building the second space fleet?”",
  "",
  "“No.",
  "That’s a large particle accelerator still under construction.",
  "The plans for building a second space fleet have been scrapped.",
  "All resources are now devoted to Project Sophon.”",
  "",
  "“Project Sophon?”",
  "",
  "“Yes.",
  "We’ve kept this plan secret from most of you present.",
  "I now ask the science consul to give an introduction.”",
  "",
  "“I knew about this plan, but didn’t know it had progressed so far.”",
  "The speaker was the industry consul.",
  "",
  "The culture and education consul said, “I knew about this plan as well, but thought it was like a fairy tale.”",
  "",
  "The science consul said, “Project Sophon, to put it simply, aims to transform a proton into a superintelligent computer (*42).”",
  "",
  "*42- Translator’s Note: There is a pun in Chinese between the word for a proton, zhizi (), and the word for a sophon, zhizi.",
  "",
  "“This is a science fantasy that most of us have heard about,” the agricultural consul said.",
  "“But can it be realized?",
  "I know that physicists can already manipulate nine of the eleven dimensions of the micro-scale world, but we still can’t imagine how they could stick a pair of tiny tweezers into a proton to build large-scale integrated circuits.”",
  "",
  "“Of course that’s impossible.",
  "The etching of micro integrated circuits can only occur at the macro scale, and only on a macroscopic two-dimensional plane.",
  "Thus, we must unfold a proton into two dimensions.”",
  "",
  "“Unfold a nine-dimensional structure into two dimensions?",
  "How big would the area be?”",
  "",
  "“Very big, as you will see.”",
  "The science consul smiled.",
  "",
  "*   *   *",
  "",
  "Another sixty thousand Trisolaran hours went by.",
  "Twenty thousand Trisolaran hours after the completion of the huge particle accelerator in space, the unfolding of the proton into two dimensions was about to begin in a synchronous orbit around Trisolaris.",
  "",
  "It was a beautiful and mild Stable Era day.",
  "The sky was particularly clear.",
  "Like the day when the fleet had set sail eighty thousand Trisolaran hours ago, the entire population of Trisolaris looked up into the sky, gazing at that giant ring.",
  "The princeps and all the consuls again came and stood under the Pendulum Monument.",
  "The pendulum had long stopped, and the weight hung still like a solid rock between the tall pillars.",
  "Looking at it, it was hard to believe that it had once moved.",
  "",
  "The science consul gave the order to unfold into two dimensions.",
  "In space, three cubes drifted around the ring—the fusion generators that powered the accelerator.",
  "Their winglike heat sinks gradually began to glow with a dim reddish light.",
  "The crowd anxiously stared at the accelerator, but nothing seemed to happen.",
  "",
  "A tenth of a Trisolaran hour later, the science consul held his earpiece to his ear and listened intently.",
  "Then he said, “Princeps, unfortunately, the unfolding failed.",
  "We reduced the dimensions by one too many, and the proton became one-dimensional.”",
  "",
  "“One-dimensional?",
  "A line?”",
  "",
  "“Yes.",
  "An infinitely thin line.",
  "Theoretically, it should be about fifteen hundred light-hours long.”",
  "",
  "“We spent the resources intended for another space fleet,” said the military consul, “just to obtain a result like this?”",
  "",
  "“In scientific experiments, there has to be a process during which kinks are worked out.",
  "After all, this was the very first time the unfolding has been tried.”",
  "",
  "The crowd dispersed in disappointment, but the experiment wasn’t over.",
  "Originally, it was thought that the one-dimensional proton would stay in synchronous orbit around Trisolaris forever, but due to friction from solar winds, pieces of the string fell back into the atmosphere.",
  "Six Trisolaran hours later, everyone outside noticed the strange lights in the air, gossamer threads that flickered in and out of existence.",
  "They soon learned from the news that this was the one-dimensional proton drifting to the ground under the influence of gravity.",
  "Even though the string was infinitely thin, it produced a field that could still reflect visible light.",
  "It was the first time people had ever seen matter not made out of atoms—the silky strands were merely small portions of a proton.",
  "",
  "“These things are so annoying.”",
  "The princeps brushed his hand against his face over and over.",
  "He and the science consul were standing on the wide steps in front of Government Center.",
  "“My face always feels itchy.”",
  "",
  "“Princeps, the feeling is purely psychological.",
  "All the strings added together have the mass of a single proton, so it’s impossible for them to have any effect on the macroscopic world.",
  "They can’t do any harm.",
  "It’s as if they don’t exist.”",
  "",
  "But the threads that fell from the sky grew more numerous and denser.",
  "Closer to ground, tiny sparkling lights filled the air.",
  "The sun and the stars all appeared inside silvery halos.",
  "The strings clung to those who went outside, and as they walked, they dragged the lights behind them.",
  "When people returned indoors, the lines glimmered under the lamps.",
  "As soon as they moved, the reflection from the strings revealed the patterns in the air currents they disturbed.",
  "Although the one-dimensional string could only be seen under light and couldn’t be felt, people became upset.",
  "",
  "The torrent of one-dimensional strings continued for more than twenty Trisolaran hours before finally ending, though not because the strings had all fallen to the ground.",
  "Although their mass was unimaginably minuscule, they still had some, and so their acceleration under gravity was the same as normal matter.",
  "However, once inside the atmosphere, they were completely dominated by the air currents and would never fall to the ground.",
  "After being unfolded into one dimension, the strong nuclear force within the proton became far more attenuated, weakening the string.",
  "Gradually, it broke into tiny pieces, and the light they reflected was no longer visible.",
  "People thought they had disappeared, but pieces of the one-dimensional string would drift in the air of Trisolaris forever.",
  "",
  "*   *   *",
  "",
  "Fifty Trisolaran hours later, the second attempt to unfold a proton into two dimensions began.",
  "Soon, the crowd on the ground saw something odd.",
  "After the heat sinks of the fusion generators began to glow red, several colossal objects appeared near the accelerator.",
  "All of them were in the form of regular geometric solids: spheres, tetrahedrons, cubes, cones, and so on.",
  "Their surfaces had complex coloration, but close examination showed that they were, in fact, colorless.",
  "The surfaces of the geometric solids were completely reflective, and what the people saw were just distorted, reflected images of the surface of Trisolaris.",
  "",
  "“Have we succeeded?”",
  "the princeps asked.",
  "“Is that the proton unfolded into two dimensions?”",
  "",
  "The science consul replied, “Princeps, it’s still a failure.",
  "I just received the report from the accelerator control center.",
  "The unfolding left one too many dimensions in, and the proton was unfolded into three dimensions.”",
  "",
  "The giant, reflective geometric solids continued to pop into existence in great numbers, and their forms became more various.",
  "There were tori, solid crosses, and even something that looked like a Möbius strip.",
  "All the geometric solids drifted away from the location of the accelerator.",
  "About half an hour later, the solids filled more than half the sky, as though a giant child had emptied a box of building blocks in the firmament.",
  "The light reflected from the mirror surfaces doubled the brilliance of the light hitting the ground, but the intensity continuously shifted.",
  "The shadow of the giant pendulum flickered in and out, and swayed from side to side.",
  "",
  "Then, all the geometric solids began to deform.",
  "They gradually lost their regular shapes, as though they were melting in heat.",
  "The deformation accelerated and the resulting lumps became more and more complex.",
  "Now the objects in the sky no longer reminded people of building blocks, but of a giant’s dismembered limbs and disemboweled viscera.",
  "Because their shapes were no longer so regular, the light they reflected to the ground became softer, but their own surface coloration turned even more strange and unpredictable.",
  "",
  "Out of the mess of three-dimensional objects, a few in particular drew special attention from observers on the ground.",
  "At first, it was only because the objects in question were very similar to each other.",
  "But upon closer examination, people recognized them, and a wave of terror swept Trisolaris.",
  "",
  "They were all eyes!",
  "[Of course, we don’t know what Trisolaran eyes look like, but we can be certain that any intelligent life would be very sensitive to representations of eyes.]",
  "",
  "The princeps was one of the few who kept calm.",
  "He asked the science consul, “How complicated can the internal structure of a subatomic particle be?”",
  "",
  "“It depends on the number of dimensions of your observation perspective.",
  "From a one-dimensional perspective, it’s only a point—that’s how ordinary people think of the particles.",
  "From a two- or three-dimensional perspective, the particle begins to show internal structure.",
  "From a four-dimensional perspective, a fundamental particle is an immense world.”",
  "",
  "The princeps said, “To use a word like ‘immense’ to describe a subatomic particle such as a proton seems incredible to me.”",
  "",
  "The science consul ignored the princeps and continued, “As we move to higher dimensions, the complexity and number of structures within a particle increase dramatically.",
  "The comparisons I’m about to make will not be precise, but should give you an idea of the scale.",
  "A particle seen from a seven-dimensional perspective has a complexity comparable to our Trisolaran stellar system in three dimensions.",
  "From an eight-dimensional perspective, a particle is a vast presence like the Milky Way.",
  "When the perspective has been raised to nine dimensions, a fundamental particle’s internal structures and complexity are equal to the whole universe.",
  "As for even higher dimensions, our physicists haven’t been able to explore them, so we cannot yet imagine the degree of complexity.”",
  "",
  "The princeps pointed to the giant eyes in space.",
  "“Do these show that the microcosmos contained within the unfolded proton harbors intelligent life?”",
  "",
  "“Our definition of ‘life’ is probably not appropriate for the high-dimensional microcosmos.",
  "More accurately, we can only say that universe contains intelligence or wisdom.",
  "Scientists have long predicted this possibility.",
  "It would have been odd for such a complex and vast world to not have evolved something akin to intelligence.”",
  "",
  "“Why have they transformed into eyes to look at us?”",
  "The princeps looked up at the eyes in space, beautiful, lifelike sculptures, all of them gazing upon the planet below strangely.",
  "",
  "“Maybe they just want to demonstrate their presence.”",
  "",
  "“Can they fall down here?”",
  "",
  "“Not at all.",
  "You may rest easy, Princeps.",
  "Even if they were to fall, the mass of all these huge structures added together is only that of a proton.",
  "Just like the one-dimensional string from last time, they won’t have any effect on our world.",
  "People just have to get used to the strange sight.”",
  "",
  "But this time, the science consul was wrong.",
  "",
  "People noticed the eyes moved faster than the other solids filling the sky, and they were gathering into one spot.",
  "Soon, two eyes met and merged into one bigger eye.",
  "More and more eyes joined this big eye, and its volume grew.",
  "Finally, all the eyes melded into one.",
  "It was so large that it seemed to represent the gaze of the universe upon Trisolaris.",
  "The iris was clear and bright, and at the center was the image of a sun.",
  "Over the broad surface of the eyeball, various colors cascaded in a flood.",
  "Soon, the details over the giant eye faded and gradually disappeared, until it became a pupil-less blind eye.",
  "Then it began to deform until it finally lost the shape of an eye and became a perfect circle.",
  "When the circle began to slowly rotate, people realized that it was not flat, but parabolic, like a slice cut from a giant sphere.",
  "",
  "As the military consul stared at the slowly spinning colossal object in space, he suddenly understood and shouted, “Princeps and others, please go into the underground bunker right away.”",
  "He pointed upward.",
  "“That is—”",
  "",
  "“A parabolic mirror,” the princeps said calmly.",
  "“Direct the space defense forces to destroy it.",
  "We will stay right here.”",
  "",
  "The parabolic mirror focused the sun’s beams onto the surface of Trisolaris.",
  "Initially, the spot of light was very large, and the heat at the focal point wasn’t yet lethal.",
  "This spot moved across the ground, searching for its target.",
  "The mirror discovered the capital, the largest city of Trisolaris, and the light spot began to move toward it.",
  "Soon, the beam was over the city.",
  "",
  "Those standing under the Pendulum Monument only saw a great brightness in space.",
  "It overwhelmed everything else, accompanied by a wave of extreme heat.",
  "Then the light spot over the capital shrank as the parabolic mirror began to focus the light more tightly.",
  "The brightness from space grew stronger until no one could lift up his head, and those standing within the spot felt the temperature rise rapidly.",
  "Just as the heat became unbearable, the edge of the light spot swept past the Pendulum Monument and everything dimmed.",
  "It took a while before the crowd’s sight readjusted to normal light.",
  "",
  "When they looked up, the first sight that greeted them was a pillar of light between the sky and earth, shaped like an inverted cone.",
  "The mirror in space formed the base of the cone, and the tip stabbed into the heart of the capital, turning everything there incandescent at once.",
  "Waves of smoke began to rise.",
  "Tornadoes caused by the uneven heat of the light cone formed several other pillars made of dust that connected to the sky, twisting and dancing around the light cone.",
  "…",
  "",
  "Several brilliant fireballs appeared in different parts of the mirror, their blue color distinct from the light reflected from the mirror.",
  "These were the exploding nuclear warheads launched by the Trisolaran space defense corps.",
  "Because the explosions were happening outside the atmosphere, there was no sound.",
  "By the time the fireballs disappeared, several large holes appeared in the mirror, and then the entire surface of the mirror began to tear and crack, until it had broken into more than a dozen pieces.",
  "",
  "The deadly light cone disappeared and the world returned to a normal level of illumination.",
  "For a moment, the sky was as dim as a moonlit night.",
  "Those broken pieces of the mirror, now devoid of intelligence, continued to deform and soon could not be distinguished from the other geometric solids in space.",
  "",
  "“What will happen with the next experiment?”",
  "The princeps’s expression was derisive as he spoke to the science consul.",
  "“Will you unfold a proton into four dimensions?”",
  "",
  "“Princeps, even if that were to occur, it’s nothing to worry about.",
  "A proton unfolded into four dimensions will be much smaller.",
  "If the space defense corps is prepared to attack its projection in three-dimensional space, it can be destroyed just the same.”",
  "",
  "“You’re deceiving the princeps!”",
  "said a furious military consul.",
  "“You have not mentioned the real danger.",
  "What if the proton is unfolded into zero dimensions?”",
  "",
  "“Zero dimensions?”",
  "The princeps was interested.",
  "“Wouldn’t that be a point with no size?”",
  "",
  "“Yes, a singularity!",
  "Even a proton would be infinitely big compared to it.",
  "The entire mass of the proton will be contained in this singularity, and its density will be infinite.",
  "Princeps, I’m sure you can imagine what that would be.”",
  "",
  "“A black hole?”",
  "",
  "“Yes.”",
  "",
  "“Princeps, let me explain,” the science consul broke in.",
  "“The reason we picked a proton instead of a neutron to unfold into two dimensions is precisely to avoid this kind of risk.",
  "If we really were to unfold into zero dimensions, the charge of a proton would also be carried over into the unfolded black hole.",
  "We can then capture and control it using electromagnetism.”",
  "",
  "“What if you can’t find it or control it?”",
  "the military consul asked.",
  "“It can then land on the ground, suck in everything it encounters, and increase its mass.",
  "Then it will sink into the core of this planet and eventually suck down all of Trisolaris.”",
  "",
  "“That will never happen.",
  "I guarantee it!",
  "Why are you always making things difficult for me?",
  "Like I said, this is a scientific experiment—”",
  "",
  "“That’s enough!”",
  "the princeps said.",
  "“What is the probability of success next time?”",
  "",
  "“Almost one hundred percent!",
  "Princeps, please believe in me.",
  "Through these two failures, we have already mastered the principles governing unfolding subatomic structures into low-dimensional macro space.”",
  "",
  "“All right.",
  "To ensure the survival of Trisolaran civilization, we must take this risk.”",
  "",
  "“Thank you!”",

  "“But if you fail again, you and all the scientists working on Project Sophon will be guilty.”",
  "",
  "“Yes, of course, all guilty.”",
  "If Trisolarans could perspire, the science consul must have been soaked in cold sweat.",
  "",
  "It was much easier to clean up the three-dimensional remnants of the unfolded proton in synchronous orbit than it was to clean up the one-dimensional string.",
  "Small spaceships were able to drag the pieces of proton matter away from Trisolaris and prevent them from entering the atmosphere.",
  "Those objects, some as large as mountains, had almost no mass.",
  "They were like immense silver illusions; even a baby could have moved them easily.",
  "",
  "Afterwards, the princeps asked the science consul, “Did we destroy a civilization in the microcosmos in this experiment?”",
  "",
  "“It was at least an intelligent body.",
  "Also, Princeps, we destroyed the entire microcosmos.",
  "That miniature universe is immense in higher dimensions, and it probably contained more than one intelligence or civilization that never had a chance to express themselves in macro space.",
  "Of course, in higher dimensional space at such micro scales, the form that intelligence or civilization may take is beyond our imagination.",
  "They’re something else entirely.",
  "And such destruction has probably occurred many times before.”",

  "“Oh?”",

  "“In the long history of scientific progress, how many protons have been smashed apart in accelerators by physicists?",
  "How many neutrons and electrons?",
  "Probably no fewer than a hundred million.",

  "In fact, even in nature, the destruction of universes must be happening at every second—for example, through the decay of neutrons.",

  "… You’re not feeling sentimental because of this, are you?”",
  "",
  "“You amuse me.",
  "I will immediately notify the propaganda consul and direct him to repeatedly publicize this scientific fact to the world.",

  "Do you wish to encourage the people to face the possible destruction of Trisolaran civilization with equanimity?”",

  "“No.",
  "It’s to encourage them to face the destruction of Earth civilization with equanimity.",
  "You know very well that after we publicized our policy toward the Earth civilization, there was a wave of extremely dangerous pacifism.",

  "The goal is to eventually wrap the unfolded proton completely around Trisolaris.",

  "Some sunlight continued to leak inside the curved proton plane, and the image of Trisolaris in this fun-house mirror in space was distorted beyond recognition.",
  "But, finally, after the last ray of sunlight was blocked, everything sank into the darkest night in the history of Trisolaris.",
  "As gravity and the electromagnetic beams balanced each other, the proton plane formed a gigantic shell in synchronous orbit around Trisolaris.",

  "A deathly silence fell over much of the darkness-enclosed surface.",
  "In the sky, only the faint light spots from the beams that held up the proton membrane flickered.",

  "This formation’s scale can be adjusted to any size, and can thus receive electromagnetic waves to sense the macro world at any frequency.",

  "After the command was issued, the four mirrored spheres disappeared.",
  "The science consul said, “Princeps, now Sophon One and Sophon Two will be launched toward the Earth.",
  "Using the large knowledge base stored in the micro circuits, the sophons understand the nature of space.",
  "They can draw energy from the vacuum and become high-energy particles in a moment, and navigate through space at nearly the speed of light.",
  "This might appear to violate the law of conservation of energy, but in fact the sophons are only ‘borrowing’ energy from the structure of vacuum.",
  "However, the time for returning such energy is far in the future, when the proton decays.",
  "By then, the end of the universe will not be far.",
  "",
  "“After the two sophons arrive on Earth, their first mission is to locate the high-energy particle accelerators used by humans for physics research and hide within them.",
  "At the level of science development on the Earth, the basic method for exploring the deep structure of matter is to use accelerated high-energy particles to collide with target particles.",
  "After the target particles have been smashed, they analyze the results to try to find information reflecting the deep structure of matter.",
  "In actual experiments, they use the substance containing the target particles as the bull’s-eye for the accelerated bullets.",

  "“But the inside of the substance being struck is almost all vacuum.",
  "Suppose an atom is the size of a theater; the nucleus is like a walnut hovering in the center of the theater.",
  "Thus, successful collisions are very rare.",
  "Often large quantities of high-energy particles must be directed against the target substance for a sustained period of time before a collision occurs.",
  "This kind of experiment is akin to looking for a raindrop of a slightly different color in a summer thunderstorm.",
  "",
  "“This gives the sophons an opening.",
  "A sophon can take the place of a target particle and accept the collision.",
  "Because they’re highly intelligent, they can precisely determine through the quantum sensing formation the paths that the accelerated particles will follow within a very short period of time and move to the appropriate location.",
  "Thus, the likelihood that a sophon will be struck will be billions of times greater than the actual target particle.",
  "After a sophon is struck, it can deliberately give out wrong and chaotic results.",
  "Thus, even if the actual target particle is occasionally struck, Earth physicists will not be able to tell the correct result from the numerous erroneous results.”",

  "“No.",
  "When a sophon is smashed into several pieces, several new sophons are born.",
  "And they continue to have secure quantum entanglements between them, just like how, if you break a magnet in half, you would get two magnets.",
  "Even though each partial sophon’s capabilities will be much lower than the original, whole sophon, under the direction of the self-healing software, the pieces will move together and reassemble into the original sophon.",
  "This process only requires a microsecond and will occur after the collision in the accelerator, and after the pieces of the sophon have left the wrong results in the bubble chamber or on sensitive film.”",

  "The hunter’s eyes have already been blinded by the prey he intends to catch.”",
  "",
  "“Humans may still resort to a brute-force method,” the industry consul said.",
  "“They can build a large number of accelerators, faster than the rate at which we can build sophons.",
  "Then, at least some accelerators on Earth will not be infiltrated by sophons and can yield the correct results.”",
  "",
  "“This is one of the most interesting aspects of Project Sophon!”",
  "The science consul was visibly excited by the question.",
  "“Mister Industry Consul, do not worry that creating large numbers of sophons will cause the collapse of the Trisolaran economy.",
  "We will not need to resort to that.",
  "We might build a few more, but not too many.",
  "Indeed, just these two are more than enough, because each sophon is capable of multitasking.”",
  "",
  "“Multitasking?”",
  "",
  "“This is a bit of jargon related to ancient serial computers.",
  "Back then, a computer’s central processing unit could only carry out a single instruction at a time.",
  "But, because it was so fast, and aided by interrupt scheduling, from our low-speed perspective, the computer was carrying out multiple programs at the same time.",
  "As you know, the sophons move at close to the speed of light.",
  "The surface of the Earth is a tiny space for sophons.",
  "If sophons patrol around the accelerators on Earth at this speed, then, from the perspective of humans, it is as if they simultaneously exist in all the accelerators and can almost simultaneously create erroneous results in all the accelerators.",
  "",
  "“By our calculations, each sophon is capable of controlling more than ten thousand high-energy accelerators.",
  "It takes about four to five years for humans to build each of these accelerators, and it seems unlikely that they can be mass produced based on their economy and available resources.",
  "Of course, they can increase the distance between the accelerators, for example, by building accelerators on the different planets in their planetary system.",
  "That would indeed destroy the multitasking operation of the sophons.",
  "But in the time it would take to do that, it would not be difficult for Trisolaris to build ten or more sophons.",
  "",
  "“More and more sophons will wander in that planetary system.",
  "Added all together, they still won’t add up to the mass of even one-billionth of a bacterium.",
  "But they will cause the physicists on Earth to never be able to glimpse the secrets hidden deep in the structure of matter.",
  "Humans will never be able to access the micro dimensions, and the ability for them to manipulate matter will be limited to below five dimensions.",
  "From now on, whether it’s four point five million hours or four hundred and fifty trillion hours, Earth civilization’s technology will never achieve this fundamental breakthrough.",
  "They will remain forever in the primitive stage.",
  "The science of Earth has been completely locked down, and the lock is so secure that humans will never be able to escape from it by their own strength.”",
  "",
  "“That’s wonderful!",
  "Please forgive my lack of respect for Project Sophon in the past.”",
  "The military consul’s tone was sincere.",
  "",
  "“In fact, there are currently only three accelerators with sufficient power to produce results that can lead to possible breakthroughs.",
  "After Sophon One and Sophon Two arrive on Earth, they will have a lot of extra capacity.",
  "In order to fully utilize the sophons, we will assign them other tasks in addition to interfering with the three accelerators.",
  "For example, they will be the main means to carry out the Miracle Plan.”",
  "",
  "“Sophons can create miracles?”",
  "",
  "“For humans, yes.",
  "Everyone knows that high-energy particles can expose film.",
  "This is one of the ways that primitive accelerators on Earth once showed individual particles.",
  "When a sophon passes through the film at high energy, it leaves behind a tiny exposed spot.",
  "If a sophon passes back and forth through the film many times, it can connect the dots to form letters or numbers or even pictures, like embroidery.",
  "The process is very fast, and far quicker than the speed at which humans expose film when taking a picture.",
  "Also, the human retina is similar to the Trisolaran one.",
  "Thus, a high-energy sophon can also use the same technique to show letters, numbers, or images on their retina.",
  "… And if these little miracles can confuse and terrify humans, then the next great miracle will be sufficient to frighten their scientists—no better than bugs—to death: Sophons can cause background cosmic radiation to flash in their eyes.”",
  "",
  "“This would be very frightening for our scientists as well.",
  "How would this be accomplished?”",
  "",
  "“Very simple.",
  "We have already written the software to allow a sophon to unfold itself into two dimensions.",
  "After the unfolding is complete, the huge plane can wrap itself around the Earth.",
  "This software can also adjust the membrane so that it’s transparent, but the degree of transparency can be tuned in the frequencies of the cosmic microwave background.",
  "… Of course, as sophons fold and unfold into different dimensions, they can display even more amazing ‘miracles.’",
  "The software for accomplishing these is still being developed, but these ‘miracles’ will create a mood sufficient to divert human scientific thought onto the wrong path.",
  "This way, we can use the Miracle Plan to effectively restrain scientific endeavors outside of physics on Earth.”",
  "",
  "“One last question: Why not send all four of the completed sophons to Earth?”",
  "",
  "“Quantum entanglement can work at a distance.",
  "Even if four sophons were placed at opposite ends of the universe, they could still sense each other instantaneously, and the quantum formation between them would still exist.",
  "Keeping Sophon Three and Sophon Four here will enable them to receive the information sent back by Sophon One and Sophon Two instantaneously.",
  "This gives us a way to monitor the Earth in real time.",
  "Also, the sophon formation allows Trisolaris to communicate in real time with the alienated forces within Earth civilization.”",

  "A night from my childhood remains crisply etched in my memory: I was standing by a pond before a village somewhere in Luoshan County, Henan Province, where generations of my ancestors had lived.",
  "Next to me stood many other people, both adults and children.",
  "Together, we gazed up at the clear night sky, where a tiny star slowly glided across the dark firmament.",
  "",
  "It was the first artificial satellite China had ever launched: Dongfanghong I (“The East is Red I”).",
  "The date was April 25, 1970, and I was seven.",
  "",
  "It had been thirteen years since Sputnik had been launched into space, and nine years since the first cosmonaut had left the Earth.",
  "Just a week earlier, Apollo 13 had safely returned from a perilous journey to the moon.",
  "",
  "But I didn’t know any of that.",
  "As I gazed at that tiny, gliding star, my heart was filled with indescribable curiosity and yearning.",
  "And etched in my memory just as deeply as these feelings was the sensation of hunger.",
  "At that time, the region around my village was extremely poor.",
  "Hunger was the constant companion of every child.",
  "I was relatively fortunate because I had shoes on my feet.",
  "Most of the friends standing by my side were barefoot, and some of the tiny feet still had unhealed frostbite from the previous winter.",
  "Behind me, faint light from kerosene lamps shone out of cracks in the walls of dilapidated thatched huts—the village wasn’t wired for electricity until the eighties.",
  "",
  "The adults standing nearby said that the satellite wasn’t like an airplane because it flew outside of the Earth.",
  "Back then the dust and smoke of industry hadn’t yet polluted the air, and the starry sky was especially clear, with the Milky Way clearly visible.",
  "In my mind, the stars that filled the heavens weren’t much farther away than the tiny, gliding satellite, and so I thought it was flying among them.",
  "I even worried that it might collide with one as it passed through the dense stellar clusters.",
  "",
  "My parents weren’t with me because they were working at a coal mine more than a thousand kilometers away, in Shanxi Province.",
  "A few years earlier, when I had been even younger, the mine had been a combat zone for the factional civil wars of the Cultural Revolution.",
  "I remembered gunshots in the middle of the night, trucks passing in the street, filled with men clutching guns and wearing red armbands.",
  "… But I had been too young back then, and I can’t be sure whether these images are real memories, or mirages constructed later.",
  "However, I know one thing for certain: Because the mine was too unsafe and my parents had been impacted by the Cultural Revolution, they had had no choice but to send me to my ancestral home village in Henan.",
  "By the time I saw Dongfanghong I, I had already lived there for more than three years.",
  "",
  "A few more years passed before I understood the distance between that satellite and the stars.",
  "Back then I was reading a popular set of basic science books called A Hundred Thousand Whys.",
  "From the astronomy volume, I learned the concept of a light-year.",
  "Before then, I had already known that light could traverse a distance equal to seven and a half trips around the Earth in a single second, but I had not contemplated what kind of terrifying distance could be crossed by flying at such a speed for a whole year.",
  "I imagined a ray of light passing through the cold silence of space at the speed of 300,000 kilometers per second.",
  "I struggled to grasp the bone-chilling vastness and profundity with my imagination, felt the weight of an immense terror and awe, and simultaneously enjoyed a druglike euphoria.",
  "",
  "From that moment, I realized that I had a special talent: Scales and existences that far exceeded the bounds of human sensory perception—both macro and micro—and that seemed to be only abstract numbers to others, could take on concrete forms in my mind.",
  "I could touch them and feel them, much like others could touch and feel trees and rocks.",
  "Even today, when references to the 15-billion-light-year radius of the universe and “strings” many orders of magnitude smaller than quarks have numbed most people, the concepts of a light-year or a nanometer can still produce lively, grand pictures in my mind and arouse in me an ineffable, religious feeling of awe and shock.",
  "Compared to most of the population who do not experience such sensations, I don’t know if I’m lucky or unlucky.",
  "But it is certain that such feelings made me first into a science fiction fan, and later a science fiction author.",
  "",
  "In that same year when I was first awed by the concept of a light-year, a flood (known as the Great Flood of August ’75) occurred near my home village.",
  "In a single day, a record-breaking 100.5 centimeters of rain fell in the Zhumadian region of Henan.",
  "Fifty-eight dams of various sizes collapsed, one after another, and 240,000 people died in the resulting deluge.",
  "Shortly after the floodwaters had receded, I returned to the village and saw a landscape filled with refugees.",
  "I thought I was looking at the end of the world.",
  "",
  "And so, satellite, hunger, stars, kerosene lamps, the Milky Way, the Cultural Revolution’s factional civil wars, a light-year, the flood … these seemingly unconnected things melded together and formed the early part of my life, and also molded the science fiction I write today.",
  "",
  "As a science fiction writer who began as a fan, I do not use my fiction as a disguised way to criticize the reality of the present.",
  "I feel that the greatest appeal of science fiction is the creation of numerous imaginary worlds outside of reality.",
  "I’ve always felt that the greatest and most beautiful stories in the history of humanity were not sung by wandering bards or written by playwrights and novelists, but told by science.",
  "The stories of science are far more magnificent, grand, involved, profound, thrilling, strange, terrifying, mysterious, and even emotional, compared to the stories told by literature.",
  "Only, these wonderful stories are locked in cold equations that most do not know how to read.",
  "",
  "The creation myths of the various peoples and religions of the world pale when compared to the glory of the big bang.",
  "The three-billion-year history of life’s evolution from self-reproducing molecules to civilization contains twists and romances that cannot be matched by any myth or epic.",
  "There is also the poetic vision of space and time in relativity, the weird subatomic world of quantum mechanics … these wondrous stories of science all possess an irresistible attraction.",
  "Through the medium of science fiction, I seek only to create my own worlds using the power of imagination, and to make known the poetry of Nature in those worlds, to tell the romantic legends that have unfolded between Man and Universe.",
  "",
  "But I cannot escape and leave behind reality, just like I cannot leave behind my shadow.",
  "Reality brands each of us with its indelible mark.",
  "Every era puts invisible shackles on those who have lived through it, and I can only dance in my chains.",
  "In science fiction, humanity is often described as a collective.",
  "In this book, a man named “humanity” confronts a disaster, and everything he demonstrates in the face of existence and annihilation undoubtedly has sources in the reality that I experienced.",
  "The wonder of science fiction is that it can, when given certain hypothetical world settings, turn what in our reality is evil and dark into what is righteous and bright, and vice versa.",
  "This book and its two sequels try to do just that, but no matter how reality is twisted by imagination, it ultimately remains there.",
  "",
  "I’ve always felt that extraterrestrial intelligence will be the greatest source of uncertainty for humanity’s future.",
  "Other great shifts, such as climate change and ecological disasters, have a certain progression and built-in adjustment periods, but contact between humankind and aliens can occur at any time.",
  "Perhaps in ten thousand years, the starry sky that humankind gazes upon will remain empty and silent, but perhaps tomorrow we’ll wake up and find an alien spaceship the size of the moon parked in orbit.",
  "The appearance of extraterrestrial intelligence will force humanity to confront an Other.",
  "Before then, humanity as a whole will never have had an external counterpart.",
  "The appearance of this Other, or mere knowledge of its existence, will impact our civilization in unpredictable ways.",
  "",
  "There’s a strange contradiction revealed by the naïveté and kindness demonstrated by humanity when faced with the universe: On Earth, humankind can step onto another continent, and without a thought, destroy the kindred civilizations found there through warfare and disease.",
  "But when they gaze up at the stars, they turn sentimental and believe that if extraterrestrial intelligences exist, they must be civilizations bound by universal, noble, moral constraints, as if cherishing and loving different forms of life are parts of a self-evident universal code of conduct.",
  "",
  "I think it should be precisely the opposite: Let’s turn the kindness we show toward the stars to members of the human race on Earth and build up the trust and understanding between the different peoples and civilizations that make up humanity.",
  "But for the universe outside the solar system, we should be ever vigilant, and be ready to attribute the worst of intentions to any Others that might exist in space.",
  "For a fragile civilization like ours, this is without a doubt the most responsible path.",

  "As a fan of science fiction, it has molded my life, and a considerable part of the science fiction I’ve read comes from America.",

  "It portrays events of interest to all of humanity, and thus science fiction should be the literary genre most accessible to readers of different nations.",

  "Pada waktu itu, wilayah di sekitar desa saya sangat miskin.",
  "Rasa lapar adalah teman setia setiap anak.",
  "Saya tergolong beruntung karena saya mengenakan sepatu.",
  "Sebagian besar teman yang berdiri di samping saya bertelanjang kaki, dan beberapa dari kaki-kaki kecil itu masih memiliki luka radang dingin yang belum sembuh dari musim dingin sebelumnya.",
  "Di belakang saya, cahaya redup dari lampu minyak tanah bersinar keluar dari celah-celah dinding gubuk beratap jerami yang reot—desa itu belum dialiri listrik hingga tahun delapan puluhan.",

  "Orang-orang dewasa yang berdiri di dekat situ berkata bahwa satelit itu tidak seperti pesawat terbang karena ia terbang di luar Bumi.",
  "Kala itu, debu dan asap industri belum mencemari udara, dan langit berbintang sangat cerah, dengan Bima Sakti yang terlihat jelas.",
  "Dalam benak saya, bintang-bintang yang memenuhi langit tidak jauh lebih jauh daripada satelit kecil yang meluncur itu, jadi saya mengira satelit itu terbang di antara mereka.",
  "Saya bahkan khawatir satelit itu akan bertabrakan dengan salah satu bintang saat melewati gugusan bintang yang padat.",
  "",
  "Orang tua saya tidak bersama saya karena mereka bekerja di tambang batu bara yang berjarak lebih dari seribu kilometer, di Provinsi Shanxi.",
  "Beberapa tahun sebelumnya, ketika saya masih lebih muda, tambang itu menjadi zona tempur bagi perang saudara antarfaksi Revolusi Kebudayaan.",
  "Saya teringat suara tembakan di tengah malam, truk-truk yang lewat di jalan, penuh dengan pria yang memegang senjata dan mengenakan ban lengan merah.",
  "… Namun, saya masih terlalu muda saat itu, dan saya tidak yakin apakah gambaran-gambaran ini adalah ingatan nyata, atau fatamorgana yang terbentuk kemudian.",
  "Namun, saya tahu satu hal dengan pasti: Karena tambang itu terlalu tidak aman dan orang tua saya terdampak oleh Revolusi Kebudayaan, mereka tidak punya pilihan selain mengirim saya ke desa leluhur saya di Henan.",
  "Pada saat saya melihat Dongfanghong I, saya sudah tinggal di sana selama lebih dari tiga tahun.",
  "",
  "Beberapa tahun lagi berlalu sebelum saya memahami jarak antara satelit itu dan bintang-bintang.",
  "Kala itu, saya sedang membaca serangkaian buku sains dasar populer berjudul Seratus Ribu Mengapa.",
  "Dari jilid astronomi, saya mempelajari konsep tahun cahaya.",
  "Sebelumnya, saya sudah tahu bahwa cahaya dapat menempuh jarak setara dengan tujuh setengah kali keliling Bumi dalam satu detik, tetapi saya belum merenungkan jarak mengerikan macam apa yang bisa ditempuh dengan terbang pada kecepatan seperti itu selama setahun penuh.",
  "Saya membayangkan seberkas cahaya melewati keheningan dingin luar angkasa dengan kecepatan 300.000 kilometer per detik.",
  "Saya berjuang untuk menangkap keluasan dan kedalaman yang menusuk tulang itu dengan imajinasi saya, merasakan beratnya teror dan kekaguman yang luar biasa, dan secara bersamaan menikmati euforia yang memabukkan.",
  "",
  "Sejak saat itu, saya menyadari bahwa saya memiliki bakat khusus: Skala dan keberadaan yang jauh melampaui batas persepsi indra manusia—baik makro maupun mikro—dan yang tampak hanya sebagai angka abstrak bagi orang lain, dapat mengambil wujud nyata dalam benak saya.",
  "Saya bisa menyentuh dan merasakannya, sama seperti orang lain bisa menyentuh dan merasakan pohon dan batu.",
  "Bahkan hari ini, ketika referensi tentang jari-jari alam semesta yang mencapai 15 miliar tahun cahaya dan “dawai” yang jauh lebih kecil daripada quark telah membuat sebagian besar orang mati rasa, konsep tahun cahaya atau nanometer masih dapat menghasilkan gambaran yang hidup dan agung dalam benak saya serta membangkitkan perasaan takzim dan guncangan religius yang tak terlukiskan.",
  "Dibandingkan dengan sebagian besar populasi yang tidak mengalami sensasi seperti itu, saya tidak tahu apakah saya beruntung atau sial.",
  "Namun yang pasti, perasaan seperti itulah yang membuat saya awalnya menjadi penggemar fiksi ilmiah, dan kemudian menjadi penulis fiksi ilmiah.",
  "",
  "Pada tahun yang sama ketika saya pertama kali terpesona oleh konsep tahun cahaya, sebuah banjir (dikenal sebagai Banjir Besar Agustus '75) terjadi di dekat desa asal saya.",
  "Dalam satu hari, curah hujan yang memecahkan rekor setinggi 100,5 sentimeter turun di wilayah Zhumadian, Henan.",
  "Lima puluh delapan bendungan dengan berbagai ukuran runtuh, satu demi satu, dan 240.000 orang meninggal dalam air bah yang diakibatkannya.",
  "Tak lama setelah air banjir surut, saya kembali ke desa dan melihat pemandangan yang dipenuhi pengungsi.",

  "",
  "Sebagai penulis fiksi ilmiah yang berawal dari penggemar, saya tidak menggunakan fiksi saya sebagai cara terselubung untuk mengkritik realitas masa kini.",

  "Saya selalu merasa bahwa kisah-kisah terbesar dan terindah dalam sejarah umat manusia tidak dinyanyikan oleh penyair kelana atau ditulis oleh dramawan dan novelis, melainkan dikisahkan oleh sains.",
  "Kisah-kisah sains jauh lebih megah, agung, rumit, mendalam, mendebarkan, aneh, menakutkan, misterius, dan bahkan emosional, dibandingkan dengan kisah-kisah yang diceritakan oleh sastra.",

  "Ada juga visi puitis ruang dan waktu dalam relativitas, dunia subatomik yang aneh dari mekanika kuantum… kisah-kisah sains yang menakjubkan ini semuanya memiliki daya tarik yang tak tertahankan.",
  "Melalui media fiksi ilmiah, saya hanya berusaha menciptakan dunia saya sendiri menggunakan kekuatan imajinasi, dan untuk memperkenalkan puisi Alam di dunia-dunia tersebut, untuk menceritakan legenda romantis yang telah terbentang antara Manusia dan Alam Semesta.",

  "Realitas memberi cap pada kita masing-masing dengan tandanya yang tak terhapuskan.",

  "Dalam fiksi ilmiah, umat manusia sering digambarkan sebagai sebuah kolektif.",
  "Dalam buku ini, seorang manusia bernama “umat manusia” menghadapi bencana, dan segala sesuatu yang ia tunjukkan dalam menghadapi eksistensi dan pemusnahan tidak diragukan lagi bersumber dari realitas yang saya alami.",
  "Keajaiban fiksi ilmiah adalah bahwa ia dapat, jika diberi latar dunia hipotetis tertentu, mengubah apa yang dalam realitas kita jahat dan gelap menjadi sesuatu yang benar dan terang, dan sebaliknya.",

  "Mungkin dalam sepuluh ribu tahun, langit berbintang yang ditatap umat manusia akan tetap kosong dan sunyi, tetapi mungkin besok kita bangun dan menemukan pesawat ruang angkasa alien seukuran bulan terparkir di orbit.",
  "Munculnya kecerdasan luar angkasa akan memaksa umat manusia untuk menghadapi suatu Liyan.",

  "TRANSLATOR’S POSTSCRIPT",
  "",
  "- - -",
  "",
  "When I was asked to translate The Three-Body Problem, I was incredibly honored, but also full of trepidation: Translating another writer’s work is a heavy responsibility.",
  "It’s almost like being asked to care for someone’s child.",
  "",
  "The act of translation involves breaking down one piece of work in one language and ferrying the pieces across a gulf to reconstitute them into a new work in another language.",
  "When the gulf separating the two is as wide as the Pacific Ocean that separates China from America, the task can be daunting.",
  "",
  "The obvious difficulties, such as differences in linguistic structure and cultural references, are actually relatively easy to resolve.",
  "The Three-Body Problem begins with the Cultural Revolution, and there are numerous allusions to Chinese history.",
  "I’ve tried to keep the number of explanatory footnotes to a bare minimum by, wherever possible, filling in the necessary knowledge for non-Chinese readers by the judicious addition of a few informational phrases in the text (all approved by the author).",
  "",
  "But there are more subtle issues involving literary devices and narrative techniques.",
  "The Chinese literary tradition shaped and was shaped by its readers, giving rise to different emphases and preferences in fiction compared to what American readers expect.",
  "In some cases, I tried to adjust the narrative techniques to ones that American readers are more familiar with.",
  "In other cases, I’ve left them alone, believing that it’s better to retain the flavor of the original.",
  "",
  "I’ve also tried, wherever possible, to avoid shading Western interpretations into those passages dealing with Chinese history and politics.",
  "",
  "Overly literal translations, far from being faithful, actually distort meaning by obscuring sense.",
  "But translations can also pay so little attention to the integrity of the source that almost nothing of the original’s flavor or voice survives.",
  "Neither of these approaches is a responsible fulfillment of the translator’s duty.",
  "In a sense, translating may be harder than writing original fiction because a translator must strive to satisfy the same aesthetic demands while being subjected to much more restrictive creative constraints.",
  "",
  "In translating, my goal is to act as a faithful interpreter, preserving as much of the original’s nuances of meaning as possible without embellishment or omission.",
  "Yet a translator must also balance fidelity to the source, aptness of expression, and beauty of style.",
  "The best translations into English do not, in fact, read as if they were originally written in English.",
  "The English words are arranged in such a way that the reader sees a glimpse of another culture’s patterns of thinking, hears an echo of another language’s rhythms and cadences, and feels a tremor of another people’s gestures and movements.",
  "",
  "I may not have succeeded, but these were the standards I had in mind as I set about my task.",
  "",
  "In moving from one language, culture, and reading community to another language, culture, and reading community, some aspects of the original are inevitably lost.",
  "But if the translation is done well, some things are also gained—not the least of which is a bridge between the two readerships.",
  "I hope my fellow American readers enjoy this novel.",
  "",
  "I am indebted to the following individuals, who gave me invaluable feedback on various drafts of this translation: Eric Abrahamsen, Anatoly Belilovsky, Aliette de Bodard, David Brin, Eric Choi, John Chu, Elías F.",
  "Combarro, Hui Geng, Michael Kwan, Derwin Mak, Joel Martinsen, Erica Naone, Alex Saltman, Alex Shvartsman, Marie Staver, Igor Teper, Bingen Yang, Bingwei Yang, and E.",
  "Lily Yu.",
  "I lack words to sufficiently express my gratitude for their help in making this translation better, and I wish every translator had such wonderful beta readers.",
  "",
  "Others also deserve thanks.",
  "Joe Monti, my former agent (and current editor of my original fiction), dispensed much useful advice.",
  "Liz Gorinsky, my editor at Tor Books, helped me improve the translation in a thousand ways large and small, and I can’t imagine a better editorial experience than working with her.",
  "My wife, Lisa, provided the support and encouragement to keep me going on many late nights.",
  "More than anyone else, she made this possible.",

  "Finally, I thank Liu Cixin, who entrusted me with his work and, in this process, became my friend.",

  "CATATAN PENUTUP PENERJEMAH",
  "",
  "- - -",
  "",
  "Ketika saya diminta untuk menerjemahkan The Three-Body Problem, saya merasa sangat terhormat, tetapi juga penuh kecemasan: Menerjemahkan karya penulis lain adalah tanggung jawab yang berat.",
  "Rasanya hampir seperti diminta untuk merawat anak seseorang.",
  "",
  "Tindakan penerjemahan melibatkan proses membongkar sebuah karya dalam satu bahasa dan menyeberangkan kepingan-kepingan itu melintasi jurang pemisah untuk menyusunnya kembali menjadi karya baru dalam bahasa lain.",
  "Ketika jurang yang memisahkan keduanya selebar Samudra Pasifik yang memisahkan Tiongkok dan Amerika, tugas tersebut bisa terasa menakutkan.",
  "",
  "Kesulitan-kesulitan yang nyata, seperti perbedaan struktur bahasa dan referensi budaya, sebenarnya relatif mudah diatasi.",
  "The Three-Body Problem dimulai dengan Revolusi Kebudayaan, dan terdapat banyak kiasan mengenai sejarah Tiongkok.",
  "Saya berusaha meminimalkan jumlah catatan kaki penjelas dengan cara, sebisa mungkin, melengkapi pengetahuan yang diperlukan bagi pembaca non-Tionghoa melalui penambahan frasa informatif secara cermat di dalam teks (semuanya telah disetujui oleh penulis).",
  "",
  "Namun, ada masalah-masalah yang lebih halus yang melibatkan gaya bahasa dan teknik narasi.",
  "Tradisi sastra Tiongkok membentuk dan dibentuk oleh para pembacanya, sehingga memunculkan penekanan dan preferensi dalam fiksi yang berbeda dibandingkan dengan apa yang diharapkan pembaca Amerika.",
  "Dalam beberapa kasus, saya mencoba menyesuaikan teknik narasi dengan teknik yang lebih akrab bagi pembaca Amerika.",
  "Dalam kasus lain, saya membiarkannya apa adanya, karena yakin bahwa lebih baik mempertahankan cita rasa aslinya.",
  "",
  "Saya juga berusaha, sebisa mungkin, untuk menghindari masuknya interpretasi Barat ke dalam bagian-bagian yang membahas sejarah dan politik Tiongkok.",
  "",
  "Terjemahan yang terlalu harfiah, alih-alih setia pada teks aslinya, justru mendistorsi makna dengan mengaburkan maksudnya.",
  "Namun, terjemahan juga bisa begitu mengabaikan integritas sumbernya sehingga hampir tidak ada cita rasa atau suara asli yang tersisa.",
  "Tak satu pun dari pendekatan ini merupakan pemenuhan tugas penerjemah yang bertanggung jawab.",
  "Dalam arti tertentu, menerjemahkan mungkin lebih sulit daripada menulis fiksi orisinal karena seorang penerjemah harus berusaha memenuhi tuntutan estetika yang sama sambil tunduk pada batasan kreatif yang jauh lebih ketat.",
  "",
  "Dalam menerjemahkan, tujuan saya adalah bertindak sebagai juru bahasa yang setia, melestarikan sebanyak mungkin nuansa makna asli tanpa hiasan atau penghilangan.",
  "Namun, seorang penerjemah juga harus menyeimbangkan kesetiaan pada sumber, ketepatan ekspresi, dan keindahan gaya bahasa.",
  "Terjemahan terbaik ke dalam bahasa Inggris sebenarnya tidak terbaca seolah-olah aslinya ditulis dalam bahasa Inggris.",
  "Kata-kata bahasa Inggris disusun sedemikian rupa sehingga pembaca melihat sekilas pola pikir budaya lain, mendengar gema irama dan kadensa bahasa lain, serta merasakan getaran gerak-gerik dan pergerakan bangsa lain.",
  "",
  "Saya mungkin tidak berhasil sepenuhnya, tetapi inilah standar yang saya pegang saat memulai tugas saya.",
  "",
  "Dalam perpindahan dari satu bahasa, budaya, dan komunitas pembaca ke bahasa, budaya, dan komunitas pembaca lain, beberapa aspek asli pasti hilang.",
  "Namun, jika penerjemahan dilakukan dengan baik, ada juga hal-hal yang didapat—salah satunya, dan yang tak kalah penting, adalah jembatan antara kedua kelompok pembaca.",
  "Saya berharap rekan-rekan pembaca Amerika saya menikmati novel ini.",
  "",
  "Saya berutang budi kepada individu-individu berikut, yang memberikan masukan tak ternilai pada berbagai draf terjemahan ini: Eric Abrahamsen, Anatoly Belilovsky, Aliette de Bodard, David Brin, Eric Choi, John Chu, Elías F.",
  "Combarro, Hui Geng, Michael Kwan, Derwin Mak, Joel Martinsen, Erica Naone, Alex Saltman, Alex Shvartsman, Marie Staver, Igor Teper, Bingen Yang, Bingwei Yang, dan E.",
  "Lily Yu.",
  "Saya kehabisan kata-kata untuk mengungkapkan rasa terima kasih saya atas bantuan mereka dalam menyempurnakan terjemahan ini, dan saya berharap setiap penerjemah memiliki pembaca beta yang luar biasa seperti mereka.",
  "",
  "Pihak lain juga layak mendapatkan ucapan terima kasih.",
  "Joe Monti, mantan agen saya (dan editor fiksi orisinal saya saat ini), memberikan banyak saran yang berguna.",
  "Liz Gorinsky, editor saya di Tor Books, membantu saya meningkatkan terjemahan ini dalam ribuan cara besar maupun kecil, dan saya tidak bisa membayangkan pengalaman editorial yang lebih baik daripada bekerja bersamanya.",
  "Istri saya, Lisa, memberikan dukungan dan dorongan semangat agar saya terus maju di banyak malam yang larut.",
  "Lebih dari siapa pun, dialah yang membuat ini menjadi mungkin.",
  "",
  "Terakhir, saya berterima kasih kepada Liu Cixin, yang memercayakan karyanya kepada saya dan, dalam proses ini, menjadi sahabat saya.",
